 Resume Work Prompt

  I'm ready to continue developing the Eternal Spiral 2.5D tactical JRPG
  using the TypeScript game engine we implemented.

  **Current Status:**
  - Core game engine systems completed (GameEngine, StateManager,
  RenderSystem, InputSystem, AssetManager, ECS)
  - TypeScript configuration and build system set up
  - Project structure established following clean architecture patterns

  **What I'd like to work on next:**
  [Choose one or describe your priority]
  - Set up the initial game and create the main entry point
  - Implement the 7x7 combat grid system with visual rendering
  - Build the character creation and progression systems
  - Create the UI components for combat interface
  - Implement specific game mechanics (Patternstrike, turn order, etc.)
  - Set up the asset pipeline and load game sprites/audio
  - Write tests for the core engine systems
  - [Other specific area you want to focus on]

  **Context:**
  Use the Game Development Template methodology. The engine follows a layered
   architecture with React for UI, Zustand for state management, and an ECS
  pattern for game entities. The game features grid-based tactical combat on
  a 7x7 battlefield with a Conditional Turn-Based system and Action Points.

  Please help me implement the next phase of development.

 ※ Tip: Start with small features or bug fixes, tell Claude to propose a plan, and verify its suggested edits

> Using the Game Development Template, analyze the attached game design documents in the `docs` directory for a 2.5D web-based RPG.

  Focus specifically on:
  - Game mechanics completeness and clarity
  - Technical feasibility for web deployment
  - Missing specifications that will impact implementation
  - Potential design conflicts or ambiguities

  Identify the top 5 most critical gaps that need resolution before architecture planning.

⏺ 2.5D Web RPG Design Analysis

  Objective

  Analysis of game design documents for technical feasibility, mechanics completeness, and critical implementation gaps.

  Scope

  Core design documents including Unified GDD, combat systems, progression mechanics, and supporting documentation.

  ---
  Analysis/Findings

  Game Mechanics Completeness: The design documentation shows strong depth in core systems:
  - Patternstrike combat system is well-defined with CTB mechanics, AP system, and grid manipulation
  - Spiral Lattice progression system provides clear node-based advancement
  - Exousia metaphysical framework integrates throughout all systems
  - Character roles and enemy types are thoroughly specified

  Technical Feasibility for Web Deployment:
  - 7x7 grid-based combat is highly suitable for web deployment
  - Turn-based mechanics eliminate real-time performance concerns
  - 2.5D approach allows for optimized asset delivery
  - UI wireframes indicate web-appropriate interface design
  - JSON data structures are already specified for progression system

  Design Conflicts Identified:
  - Grid size inconsistency: Core GDD specifies 7x7, legacy PatternStrike doc references 9x9
  - Combat system discrepancies between documents (AP costs, turn mechanics)
  - Progression system overlaps between Spiral Lattice and Sympathetic Relics
  - Awakening mechanic percentages vary across documents (5-15% vs fixed values)

  Top 5 Critical Gaps

  1. Platform-Specific Technical Architecture
    - Gap: No web technology stack specification (JavaScript framework, rendering engine, data persistence)
    - Impact: Cannot begin technical implementation without technology decisions
    - Priority: Critical - blocks all development
  2. Asset Pipeline and Content Creation Specifications
    - Gap: Missing 2.5D art style guide, asset dimensions, animation specifications
    - Impact: Artists cannot create consistent, web-optimized assets
    - Priority: Critical - required for visual development
  3. Data Persistence and Save System Design
    - Gap: No specification for player progress storage, cloud saves, or offline capability
    - Impact: Cannot implement character progression or game state management
    - Priority: High - essential for RPG functionality
  4. Performance Requirements and Optimization Strategy
    - Gap: No target performance metrics, load time requirements, or device compatibility specs
    - Impact: Risk of poor user experience on lower-end devices/connections
    - Priority: High - affects scalability and accessibility
  5. Reconciled Combat System Specification
    - Gap: Inconsistent mechanics between documents need definitive resolution
    - Impact: Development team confusion, potential rework, inconsistent gameplay
    - Priority: High - core gameplay depends on clear mechanics

  Questions for Clarification

  1. Technology Stack: What web frameworks/libraries are preferred for the 2.5D implementation?
  2. Grid Resolution: Should the game use 7x7 or 9x9 combat grid as the canonical specification?
  3. Monetization Integration: How should the web version handle premium features and DLC mentioned in the GDD?
  4. Browser Compatibility: What are the minimum supported browser versions and features required?

  Next Steps

  Prioritize resolving the critical gaps before proceeding with technical architecture planning. The core game design is solid but needs
  implementation-specific details for web deployment success.

> 1. Propose a complete technology stack and high level architecture. This proposal 
  should follow a clean architectural pattern and prioritize maintainability and 
  scalability. Your response should be structured as follows:\
  A. Proposed tech stack: list and justify your choices.\
  B. High-Level Architecture: Use a diagram or detailed text to describe the main 
  components.\
  C. Extensibility Plan: Explain how the architecture would support adding new 
  features without refactoring.\
  D. Best Practices Plan: Detail how the architecture would incorporate best practices
   for testing and separation of concerns, as well as any other listed best 
  practices.\
  2. The game should use 7x7 but should be easily adjustable following playtesting.\
  3. Cut monetization for now and assume that the game will be sold as a standalone 
  product.\
  4. Include suggestions for these in your tech stack proposal

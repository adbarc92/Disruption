# Core
## Background
Disruption is set in a fantasy world.
The cosmogyny of this world is similar to Gnosticism in order: the Monad created the Second through Reflection, and together they created the Son.
The Son created a series of Virtues and Vices.

The Virtues and Vices paired off to create different races of men.
Two of these races are the Sourcerers and Shapers.
Sourcerers generate power and can exert it as direct force around themselves.
Shapers can direct power from the natural world around them.
They realized that they were stronger in tandem, and occasionally were able to interbreed, resulting in Glyphein.

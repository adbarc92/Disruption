 Brief History of Marxist Class Struggle
Following the Event which alters the bloodlines… (?), 0 NE
Tribes, the world over, are affected differently and develop reality-defining characteristics  
In the relevant area, two major tribes exist: the predecessors to Conduits and the predecessors to Wielders.
The Wielders are able to USE magic, so they regularly conquer and enslave members of the other tribe, whenever possible
Magical system is classical-ish, therefore tremendous combat advantage
The Conduits attempt to fight back, but are usually routed, captured, and enslaved
Copulation between Wielders and Conduits is fairly common, but Glyphein are not significant because they are only used as sub-par power source replacements
Conduits also typically lack Wielder fertility, which means that pregnancy was significantly less likely (which made them ideal sexy slaves)
The Conduits orchestrate a pseudo-revolt--coordinating between the many enslaved and their tribe(s) in the wilderness 30 NE (has not been long enough to lose tribal identity, coordinated push of revenge right as centralization/industrialization begins)
The vast majority of slaves commit mass suicide, so as to derail the Wielder “society” by depriving them of technology 
The tribes flee, while those within the Wielder society vie for control of the remaining Conduits, placing them in a position of power
Roughly 20 Conduits choose to ignore the call for suicide (the people that don’t are more selfish and/or savvy?)
A few Conduits voluntarily cooperated, which hadn’t previously occurred on this scale
The few instances of cooperation were dismissed as circumstantial factors--exceptionally powerful Conduits (mistaking cause and effect?)
Word spread that Conduits produce SIGNIFICANTLY more power if they do so voluntarily 
No amount of their will is spent resisting the process
Conduits are suddenly rocketed into positions of phenomenal demand and influence as they now serve who they choose
They are aggressively courted by military groups, and some public civil works agencies
The Conduits, over the course of a few generations, multiply and assume the role of the oligarchy in Wielder society
 Because Conduits are of frail constitution--on the basis of their condition--they also lack Wielder fertility
As a class, they tend to push the limits of their low fertility because more children essentially meant greater power and even more money


History of Past Magitech Land
Many types of magic have existed throughout the centuries...
The type that is most relevant to the common area is Reconnection (surge repair/control); this is used to repair devices which have been mass-produced, but have closed-circuit magic channels, powered by Sparks derived from Conduits
To be a Conduit is more accurately called a condition, as the act of directing magic is involuntary
It is the result of a genetic condition, wherein the seams attaching one to the Source have thinned
It is caused partly by the ways that Conduit families have become isolated from the rest of society
They only intermingle, which is not necessarily taboo to them, although they are aware of the deleterious effects of incest
They rarely marry and reproduce outside their own social circles; this is because since it is known that the Conduit condition is genetic, and so it would be foolhardy to risk "polluting" their bloodlines
The Conduit gene is not incompatible with the ability to Wield, and as such there have been cases where individuals have been doubly-blessed; this is usually the result of interbreeding with the lower class
These figures have nearly all been exceedingly bright, important individuals--they were able to explore technologies denied others, but were also all sources of societal discord--they represented the melding of the Conduits and the Wielders, which the former grudgingly acknowledged while the latter celebrated their success
It raised important and difficult questions for both sides--were they satisfied with the arrangement, as things were?
Upper Society was dominated by Conduits because their innate power made them invaluable commodities, which in turn made them exceedingly wealthy, and which was compounded as every generation added to their predecessor's fortune
HISTORY: Conduits have not always been lauded for their powers. Once, they were treated as slaves--batteries to be bought and sold--but that was centuries ago; most have forgotten or never known, a few still bear grudges
On the other hand, the nature of the powers tend to be at odds with one another, given their natures--a strong Wielder cannot afford to be Frayed, which is what allows Conduits to exist
Conduit families also tend to be quite large, as every child will invariably increase the influence of the family dynasty
However, the Conduit gene is known to be related to fertility, which means that Conduit families do not usually expand beyond five or six children
Thus far, the vast, VAST majority of Devices have been created by one of the few Melders--a term for people who can both Conduct the power and Wield it
After invention, they can be mass-produced, easily
Designs are replicated, a process called Formation
They are charged with a Spark, derived from one of a Conduit
Although, Sparkboxes are often used to store massive bursts of Sparks, as well, for transportation and distribution
After the new, copied Device has been charged with a Spark, circuitry must be correctly aligned, which is what Wielders do
If the Device is damaged or malfunctions, Wielders serve as mechanics
Devices
Specifics of Function:
Components:
Germ: a container of hardened Exousia which is the central site of power imbuement; created by Glyphs, only, prior to the advent of mass production
Source: charge contained within the germ, imparted solely on the whim of Conduits
Set: instructions, specific to each device, which configure its function; can be altered by skilled Aligners, but typically are just repaired by them
Form: the physical vessel for the power of the device; mass produced in the current age
Details:
Many devices have been created, so far
Devices which allow for instant transportation are currently in development
Devices are not merely technological advances, they allow for people to link minds
Telekinesis, Danger Sense, Protective Wards, Gravity Wells, Limited Flight, Energy Conversion,
Some Devices are more violent in nature, but these are only produced for Lackeys, the government’s official grunts
Other devices currently being tested allow for the creation of force barriers, which would be installed in cars to minimize collision damage, a device which would allow its bearer to become sharper of mind or more awake
Some black market devices include variant firearms, such as the bubble shot, energy cannon, and Wresters--which drains the target of life force
There are even a few Sparktakers as well, which render Devices inert on contact, stealing the Spark for use elsewhere
There are a number of repair tools for the Wielders, such as goggles which improve sight, magnification, and sight beyond the normal spectrum, and scanners, which will attempt to pinpoint sources of errors
Healing devices include those which enhance the process of cell regeneration and recovery, as well as those which somehow restore the person by reversing temporal aspects of their physical condition
These are OP, though
There may be some devices that allow you to completely rewrite a person’s magical pattern, completely resetting the mind of the person, but these claims are unsubstantiated

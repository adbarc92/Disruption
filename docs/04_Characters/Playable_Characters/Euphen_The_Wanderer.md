## History

Euphen’s story begins in the distant future of our current timeline, in our reality. Following the ascension and subsequent slaying of San’Kyne, San’Thradenar sought a more permanent legacy than the transience of his intellectual and philosophical contributions. In what many considered a fit of madness, he traversed the universe seeking biologically-compatible organisms with whom to mate, and on an unnamed planet far removed from the Intergalactic Union, Euphen was born to a nomadic tribeswoman who was to be wed to a local chieftain. A brilliant child, his strained relationship with his foster father (who’d always suspected infidelity) led to a tumultuous childhood. Still, Euphen received a keepsake his mother had received from Thradenar—a pendant of unknown material—which would eventually guide him to a Union ship, on which he would escape.

Stowing away on a ship, Euphen never received a suit to shield against quantum entanglement, and thus when traveling through quantum space, he was directly exposed which, in tandem with his transcendent medallion and paternal exposure to the divine, untethered him from his native reality. Thus, Euphen was free to explore and travel to many worlds, which nicely coincided with both his past and nature—he is a vagrant and loner at heart.

Euphen travels freely between the worlds, seeking dangerous beasts to slay and new adventures to be had. Thus he passed into the Monus world.

# Demeanor

Euphen tends to greet everyone and everything around him with a carefree joviality. He is somewhat detached from the world, and realizes that nothing lasts forever, but one may as well be cheerful. He has succeeded in saving many worlds, and has also failed; this is difficult for him, as he realizes that success is not guaranteed and failure has many real costs. Under pressure, his true personality is revealed: intense, hyper-focused, and exacting.

Generally speaking, he tends to be easygoing, friendly, and inquisitive. He loves experiencing the many worlds, and loves trying their food, learning their cultures, and meeting people everywhere. He tends to be very outgoing and upbeat.

He is not a man to be easily taken advantage of. When exploited, the ne’er-do-well will often find that they have paid the price, instead.

Beneath it all, Euphen is lonely. He has no home, no place in reality, and his friends and family are far away (dead?).

# Arc

While Euphen has already completed much of his character arc, there is always growing to be done. Over the course of the adventure, he must come to be invested in this world in particular. He still harbors some residual resentment for his father, and also wonders about finding his place in the world, and can relate to Cyrus on this level.

# Combat

- Euphen can work up close, but shines at range with a crossbow.
- Euphen tends to work indirectly, using traps and area control.

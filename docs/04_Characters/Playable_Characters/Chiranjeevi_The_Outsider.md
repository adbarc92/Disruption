## History

Chiranjeevi, called Kai in his youth and by close friends, has lived his life alongside his countrymen hounded by the Collective. The Vanar, a scouting group sent south from the northern Frozen Fingers, were caught in the Disruption, their magical ability to control their bodies supercharged by the latent Exousia of the land.

Chiranjeevi lost his mother in an attack on the Peaks, a clifftop outlier settlement. In the aftermath of this, he became devoted wholly to revenge, which flew in the face of the pacifistic and defensive proclivities of his people.

During the Trial, a coming-of-age ceremonial test for aspiring Guardians, Kai killed his best friend in a fit of rage and learned that his pride came with severe costs.

In the intervening years, Chiranjeevi has matured significantly, but is hesitant to assume a position of true leadership within his tribe. This has led to him becoming averse to responsibility, although he is always willing to fight when it comes down to it.

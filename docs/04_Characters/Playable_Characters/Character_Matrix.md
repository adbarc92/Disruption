# Phaidros

- Cyrus: Phaidros sees in Cyrus a budding engineer and scientist. While all of the party are outcasts, Phaidros sees in Cyrus a kindred spirit who has been estranged from his home.

- Vaughn: After the passing of Vaughn’s parents, Phaidros became a begrudging mentor figure to him. As Vaughn got older, Phaidros started to lean on Vaughn as his last consistent human connection, and their father-brother relationship evolved into one of mutual respect and reliance. Vaughn still asks Phaidros for advice.

# Euphen

- Cyrus: he looks at Cyrus as a younger version of himself—a wanderer in a strange place, confused and unsure how to navigate.
- Vaughn: he and Vaughn are both adventurous, and will tend to jump into dangerous situations with both feet, although Euphen will give a moment more thought, first.
- Phaidros: Phaidros’ intensity tends to put Euphen off a little bit.

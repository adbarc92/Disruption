## History

Born in Kyanos, Sophia's parents were mid-level members of the Collective. Her father was a governor and her mother was a matron of the arts. Their marriage was arranged, but happy. Sophia was supposed to be married off to a member of the Colletive for the cultivation of their bloodline; instead, she was always a daddy's girl, spending time with her father in his workshop. She was always a top student, her parents expecting perfection from her.

Unfortunately, following her own desires brought her nothing but misery. Both of her parents had their advancements curtailed.

She always wanted to see the outer world and contribute to some truly challenging and meaningful projects.

# Arc

Sophia's arc involves her coming to terms with her own desires and learning to make her own choices again. After being shunted into the future and away from everything she knows, she lost trust in herself and began conceding to the Collective's plot, losing faith and hope in any future of her own design. She joins the party to take control back.

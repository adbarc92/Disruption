- Sophia awakens with a new enhancement

She floated in an endless void, free from the pain of consciousness. She remembered painting with her mother and long hours spent in her father's workshop, bending the elements to their will. For a time, she dreamt of a wider world; of building the means to explore it, leveraging her mind to go beyond the sight of men, beyond even their limited imaginations. She sought to soar beyond the skies.

"--that'll do it. Soph, you awake yet?" The nasally voice was still distance, but approached with each word.

Sophia's eyes snapped open. A set of bulbous, insectoid goggles attached to a person jerked away as the man stood to height and took an involuntary step backward, knocking against his wooden stand of surgical tools, causing a bloodied knife and thin searing tool to clatter to the floor.

"By the haze," he muttered, "you never take more than a second to wake up, do you?" He took a deep breath, straightening his white overcoat and easing his large goggles up to rest over his greasy, sweat-soaked blond hair, revealing dark brown, kindly eyes. "Everyone else takes a few minutes to come to their senses. You just pop right back up like you've been waiting for me to get a move on."

"I was," Sophia lied, "and don't call me that. It's Sophia."

"You know, after all these years, I figured you'd have warmed up to me," Lucius said sheepishly, idly scratching at his hair. He bent to kneel down over his fallen tools.

Ignoring him, Sophia swung her legs over the side of the high, cushioned chair on which she sat and then stood. The room around her was largely cast in darkness, save for the spotlight that hung suspended in the air above her, but at the edges of the light she could make out a desk and several bookshelves, all of the same dark wood of the Forest.

"Severus is waiting outside, but before you go--in addition to your reflex enhancement, I also added something special I've been cooking up. Catch!"

Sophia turned as Lucius tossed something from where he now knelt. Light from the spotlight glinted dangerously off the blade as the surgical knife spun toward her in the air. Sophia snagged it deftly, suppressing the instinct to flinch away and moving only her hand to seize it from the air before it got close to piercing her. This was also something of a test, and Lucius did so enjoy testing his work. And her.

"Now," Lucius continued nonchalantly, "firmly grasp it and try to shroud it in Exousia."

Sophia did as he instructed, allowing the energy to flow from the center of her chest and down through her arm. It required some precision to surround the knife without filling it with Exousia, but she'd had plenty of practice with fine control.

To her shock, the knife appeared to vanish. She still felt the shape and weight of it in her hand, but her eyes told her she held nothing.

"Excellent!" Lucius exclaimed, clearly pleased with himself. There was a certain way he stood--a little taller, less guarded--when he was deeply self-satisfied. "Now, that will only work with your right hand, and it's easier when you have a firm hold of it, but it's a prototype I've been working on. Should make it a little easier to conceal weapons when you approach targets."

Sophia raised an eyebrow. "And you didn't inform me or anyone else ahead of time because...?"

The pride drained a bit from Lucius' posture. "Well, I wasn't sure it would work just yet. I like to be sure before I report anything. You know how much the boss hates it when things are only done halfway."

Sophia nodded, and withdrew the flow of Exousia. The knife appeared back in her hand, just where it had been. Carefully, she handed it back to him. It wouldn't do to injure him accidentally on a lark.

"I musn't keep Severus waiting. I appreciate your efforts, as usual, Lucius."

"Oh! You know it's my pleasure, Soph--ia," Lucius said with a bow. She noticed he was a little late with the end of her name, but at least he actually tried this time. Perhaps she was finally getting through to him. It had only taken several years.

She moved to the door where a cloakrack stood, and donned her black overcloak, pulling the hood over her head. The cloak settled around her, the wireframe inside causing it to flare out slightly, making her look bigger and concealing her curves. With a final glance back--Lucius had paused from tidying up his surgical space to watch her as she went--she moved to the sturdy wooden door, grasped the knocker, and pulled it open.

- Sophia speaks with her handler.
SCENE: A dusty back alley, ramshackle, poor district. Ruined, vaguely western town. The moon shines overhead, torches are placed erratically. Houses are composed of mismatched boards. A man sits on a crate, bent over and toying with something, tucked into a corner with a torch directly overhead.

The stars shone bright overhead as Sophia stepped out of the lab. Slightly ahead, Legault sat, whittling away at a wood figurine. Using a knife for something so crude would draw attention in the daylight; at night, he worked with loving finesse by flickering torch and the shining Luna.
"You're looking hale," he said without glancing up. The knife never stopped whisking across the wood.
Sophia flexed her hands.
"The flows coming off you seem denser than usual," he continued.
"How are my replacements coming along?" Legault made passes at her occasionally, but had gradually grown more subtle. She did not want to discuss anything about herself with him.
"The lady doctor's pets? I can't go into specifics, but those tykes are learning the ways."
Sophia wanted to inquire into their master's plans or any other details, but Legault's loyalties were strictly to them. No one had loyalties to her except herself.
"You do look so lovely in this light, you know?" He spoke so casually. The perpetual whisking paused. He reached out to her. "It favors your skin."
Sophia turned aside from his touch, and he smiled.
"Did you have a job for me?" She asked coldly.
"Yes, an old man in the Southern Reach. He's on the verge of cracking Exousia conversion. He must meet with an accident--lab explosion, highwaymen, to your discretion. I left an envelope on your bed with further details."
She suppressed a shiver at the thought of his hands on her bed, but privacy from the Collective was not afforded her.
She turned and left unceremoniously.
"Till next we meet, fair ice queen," he said, chuckling to himself as the whisking resumed.

- Sophia new life--she lives mostly anonymously, but makes art for a living; she is approached and propositioned often, but never known. She sometimes ventures out into the forest alone.
- Sophia receives a new assignment: kill an inventor working on technology that will convert latent safe-zone Exousia into usable energy; the technology must be disruptive to society
- Sophia struggles with this internally
- Sophia uses her new power to get close to him
- As she is about to strike, she learns he has a daughter - Leon the Professional; Sophia interacts more with the daughter and becomes invested in the daughter, she tries to save her--get her into the Collective?
- She remembers her own father, working alongside him in his workshop; her pursuit of his craft got her here
- She attempts to convince her target to give up inventing and go into hiding; she offers to help him
- He thanks her, but does not want to let down his daughter and the people around him
- Sophia kills him and is deeply tormented by this, but feels she has no other choice; she feels her will is broken
- Sophia debriefs with her handler
- Her handler informs Sophia that her target's daughter has also been killed--"no loose ends"; Sophia is somehow complicit in the daughter's death
- Back at her abode, Sophia produces one of her former target's prototypes--she impulsively used her enhancement to take it
- She briefly considers truly giving up--she is alone and has no greater plan--but decides to at least try to disrupt the Collective's operations; Sophia considers suicide because she specifically tried to help the daughter and it led to her death (Kaladin)

1. Sophia awakens with a new enhancement (blending or concealment) and speaks with her handler.

She floated in an endless void, free from the pain of consciousness. She remembered painting with her mother and long hours spent in her father's workshop, bending the elements to their will. For a time, she dreamt of a wider world; of building the means to explore it, leveraging her mind to go beyond the sight of men, beyond even their limited imaginations. She sought to soar beyond the skies.

"--that'll do it. Soph, you awake yet?"

Sophia's eyes snapped open. A set of bulbous, insectoid goggles attached to a person jerked away as the man stood to height and took an involuntary step backward, knocking against his stand of surgical tools, causing a bloodied knife and thin sparkler tool to clatter to the floor.

"By the haze," he muttered, "you never take more than a second to wake up, do you?" He took a deep breath, straightening his white overcoat and easing his large goggles up to rest over his greasy, sweat-soaked blond hair, revealing dark brown, kindly eyes. "Everyone else takes a few minutes to come to their senses. You just pop right back up like you've been waiting for me to get a move on."

"I was," Sophia lied, "and don't call me that. It's Sophia."

2. Sophia new life--she lives mostly anonymously, but makes art for a living. She is approached and propositioned often, but never known.
3. Sophia receives a new assignment: kill an inventor working on technology that will convert latent safe-zone Exousia into usable energy.
4. Sophia struggles with this internally.
5. Sophia uses her new power to get close to him.
6. As she is about to strike, she learns he has a daughter.
7. She remembers her own father, working alongside him in his workshop. Her pursuit of his craft got her here.
8. She attempts to convince her target to give up inventing and go into hiding. She offers to help him.
9. He thanks her, but does not want to let down his daughter and the people around him.
10. Sophia kills him. She is deeply tormented by this, but feels she has no other choice. She feels her will is broken.
11. Sophia debriefs with her handler.
12. Her handler informs Sophia that her target's daughter has also been killed--"no loose ends."
13. Back at her abode, Sophia produces one of her former target's prototypes--she impulsively used her enhancement to take it.
14. She briefly considers truly giving up--she is alone and has no greater plan--but decides to at least try to disrupt the Collective's operations.

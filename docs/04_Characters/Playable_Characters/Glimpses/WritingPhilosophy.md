- What does this scene accomplish? How does it start and where does it end? What does it teach us about the characters and/or the world?
- Who is involved? What are their existing relationships? What experiences are in play? What are their attitudes?
- What are the establishing shots?
- When discovering character action--what is their current headspace? How do they see the world, themselves, etc.? Do not overthink this, broad strokes. Understand enough that you can go under the immediate surface. Understand the characters' motivations in the scene well enough, and then go.
- What is happening behind the scenes?
- Always choose the most interesting scene currently happening, particularly if it will be challenging to capture.
- What emotions is this scene trying to evoke in the audience? What information should they walk away knowing about the characters and the setting?
    - A scene should always do more than merely reinforce known information.
- After one sort of scene has been done in detail, the audience can assume different permutations.
- Above all, just write. Get yourself into the headspace as best you can, and then write.

- When screenwriting, consider camera angles. Be artistic.

"Cyrus..." The voice was muffled, as though the melodious, feminine voice spoke through cotton.
"Cyrus..." The voice was clearer, but echoed softly as though spoken from the other end of a long, stone hallway.
"It's nearly time to wake up." It sounded like his mother. Her voice was clear and bright as a bell, with an inflection that made it seem she was about to break into song. Sometimes, she had.
Cyrus tried to turn over, to pull at the heavy duvet that guarded against the deathly cold of desert nights. The inner city had contraptions that trapped heat from the sun. Soon, he'd be able to afford those and many other luxuries. He'd be an Aligner. His family wouldn't have to live like this, even if his father insisted on the traditional ways.
For now, he just wanted to sleep a little longer. But when he tried to move, his arms felt heavy and soft, as though they were boneless lumps of clay attached to his shoulders, bereft of nerves and muscle.
"Cyrus, you are the penultimate and best of mine. Those that are truly mine."
The words were nonsense. Was that his mother? She'd grown up wealthy, well-educated, and liked to speak in elegant circles, playing with her words.
"Remember: in the days ahead, you cannot go back."
Cyrus dimly felt a ringing in the back of his skull; thoughts were not coming to him with the clarity to which he'd grown accustomed. Out in the desert with his father, he'd mostly used his muscles to hunt and scavenge. Lately, he'd only used his mind. Was that all he was now?
"You have my blessing, child. The torments will be real, but you will persist. You will know when the time comes."
Cyrus dimly wondered where his brother, Ram, was. Off playing in the desert, tormenting the small scavenging foxes and lizards.
"We will speak. For now, you must arise. They come."
Instantly, Cyrus burst awake. He found himself in a darkened, vaguely-familiar room--a wide, circular auditorium with rows of pew-seating all facing a deus in the middle, on which he now knelt. The room was lit by torches along the walls and on stone pedestals. Once-splendid carpets bunched up along the floor in gaps in the pews. Along the floor, Cyrus spotted Sunlets--orbs that had once hung in midair, providing light--now crashed and shattered along the ground.
In the distance, he began to hear voices, but he could not quite make out the words.
For reasons he couldn't explain, Cyrus ducked behind the deus on the farthest side from where the sounds came.

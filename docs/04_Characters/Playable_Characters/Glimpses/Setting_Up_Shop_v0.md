The First Time
	The pull began in his mind. It echoed forward from the base of his skull, at the peak of his neck.
	It was an echo, a threat.
An invitation.
	Euphen sat on the shores of Remembrance, Lord Ennis’ manmade lake. A conduit of reflection, however violent. That was all he’d said when Euphen had inquired as to its purpose.
	For his part, Euphen came here when direction proved elusive. Which seems especially often, as of late. Thoughts of his wayward apprentice seemed to haunt him, regardless of time or place. Staring out over the crystalline, manufactured shores, his regrets threatened to overwhelm him. Syx… Where have you gone? What madness has overtaken you?
	The water was still as glass, as though ripples had forever ceased.
	The hunt began eight years ago; Syxen, the unlikely predator, had become Euphen’s elusive quarry.
	Still, the sensation called to him. It sang to him. Shivers ran down from his neck, through his shoulders, and Euphen straightened abruptly. Somewhere out there, a gap has opened. They were not physical, as far as he could tell. Their nature was more ephemeral and removed than that.
	When he closed his eyes, the distant paths would appear to him--like trails of gold dust floating in a black void. Pulses of light traveled along the lines, waves of light echoing downward at varying speed. Some were bright while others were dim. As they drew near, Euphen felt a subtle pulse across his mind; he felt the urge to hum along to its rhythm--it was familiar, and he found it comforting.
	Still, he sought something new.
	The light echoed through him, and its resonance faded. He allowed two further echoes to pass him by before it came. It was dim, but persistent, and its melody filled him with a sense of sadness, something resembling nostalgia.
	He drew it in, and more potent shivers coursed through his body.
	Few had witnessed Euphen traveling. He refused to call it “teleportation”--although his phenomenon was similar, it was not quite the same. Ennis’ description returned suddenly: “It is a contradiction; you shine, and yet I am compelled to look away.”
	Euphen had, of course, never seen it. He suspected it could be done in a myriad of ways, but he’d never found the thought appealing. But then, I suppose that’s its nature, isn’t it? That which cannot be outright disguised must simply subvert attention… He considered investigating further, but there were always more pressing matters at hand.

	The texture of grass beneath him gave way to sand, causing Euphen to sink slightly. The pleasant aroma of the lakeside dispersed, and the playful lapping waters became whipping winds cutting across him.
	Abrupt, as it almost always is.
	He opened his eyes to a vast desert--rolling dunes.

...

The Second Time
The reverberations began to settle into place around him, the ground gathering to solidity at Euphen's feet. He opened his eyes to foliage; but rather than the lush greens he'd have anticipated, the colors struck him as sickly--excessively vibrant as to hurt the eyes, interspersed with patches of washed out browns fading into inky droplets. Even as he watched, new vines grew slowly along the old, leeching color and vitality.
It's as if the forest is cannibalizing itself. And no trace of the desert… I can't recall landing somewhere so distant from my original arrival zone… How much time has passed?
Perhaps his mission had expired, and he had failed. It wouldn't be the first time.
 	Sighing heavily, he slung his travel pack over his shoulder and began walking.
 
…
 
"What's your team name? Your scout ID?" The guard demanded, rather too zealously for Euphen's comfort. His compatriot stood behind him, shifting nervously from one foot to the other.
 	The gate they guarded was massive--between eighty and one-hundred feet high--and its surrounding walls were appropriately scaled.
 	"Huh. I don't have either of those things," Euphen offered affably, smiling broadly to assuage the man. "I do have a personal name, though. It's Euphen."
Despite my month off, the language is returning easily enough. Though no one would mistake me for a native, Euphen thought, extending his hand in greeting. 
 	And then withdrew it abruptly as the man crouched defensively, raising his buckler and readying his spear-like armament, which crackled with electricity. Halfway down its shaft, a translucent cylinder had been socketed into the device. It pulsed in time with the blue sparks that shot across the blade.
 	"Begone, outsider!" The aggressive guard shouted, punctuating each word with a small warning thrust. "Your belong out there, with the rest of the Forest’s diseased! You are not wanted here!" His second, a more timid guard, stepped forward hesitantly. He placed a hand on the raised spear, attempting to push it into a more defensive position. It wasn't working.
 	"Sir, he doesn't seem to be in the Forest's throes. Is it really necessary to--"
 	"YES, rookie." The aggressive man--or, as Euphen had decided to call him, "Angry Guard"--snarled. Spittle flew from his mouth as his pupils dilated. "One of these days, you'll either learn to listen to your elders or you'll get yourself killed!"
 	"Some things about human nature never seem to change, regardless of where I go…" Euphen muttered to himself.
 	"What was that, interloper?!" Angry Guard demanded, his pupils constricting as his eyes bulged. "Hear that, rookie?! He's babbling to himself. It's always the ones who seem sane at first! They retain enough cunning to be truly dangerous!"
 	"You don't seem entirely stable yourself, friend." Euphen remarked, honestly. To his eyes, minute tremors throughout the guard's body were plain, and his pupils quivered slightly, as if struggling to focus. 
Perhaps if they truly have reason to be wary of this forest's psychological effects, those near its proximity are subject to similar effects…
"DIE, fiend!" The guard screamed, lunging at him. His compatriot cried out in horror as Angry Guard charged Euphen.
 	"Pitiful." Euphen said, neatly sidestepping the feeble thrust. He grasped the spear's shaft as it whistled past; dropping into a crouch, Euphen slid a hand into a gap at the bottom of the man's breastplate. With a heave, he lifted the man and upended him, simultaneously wrenching the spear from his grasp.
 	Deftly, Euphen extracted the glowing cylinder from the spear's shaft, tucking it into a coat pocket. The younger guard made a sound halfway between groan and whimper, and ran straight past Euphen to check on his fellow.
 	With a quick glance to scan for witnesses--None on the wall, no relief for guard duty…here goes--Euphen drew the cylinder from his coat and pitched it into the nearest brush. Euphen failed to suppress a flinch as his ears barely detected the muted breaking of glass. 
Those things must be delicate. I'll have to steal another, somehow.
 	Determining that the other guard was unharmed, save for a bruised ego and a break from consciousness, the young man turned back to regard Euphen.
 	"Surely you will attest that was self-defense," Euphen ventured, raising his hands apologetically.
 	"We'll need to detain you, regardless," the young man said sternly.
 	He seems more resolute, now that he’s on his own.
 	The young man stepped forward, proffering his hand. Euphen reached forward to grasp it, smiling warmly. "What's your name, Passive Guard?"
 	The young man eyed him warily, withdrawing his hand slightly. "My name is Barak. You have something that belongs to the Aegis." At Euphen's questioning look, Barak continued, "The Aegis is Kuklos Anankes' defense force.
"How is your knowledge of this city so limited?"
 	"I'm a traveler," Euphen said with a shrug. "Venturing into the unknown is part of the job description."
 	Barak eyed him distrustfully, then reached forward once more. "The ampoule. It's rightfully ours."
 	Euphen raised an eyebrow, then lifted his coat, turning in place. Barak's eyes narrowed.
 	"We'll give you a more thorough search after you're restrained. And then we'll get you processed and into the barracks. We’ll see what happens from there." Barak's eyes narrowed. "But I saw what you did. You're quick."
 	Euphen smiled broadly, bowing slightly. He raised his hands in mock surrender. "I'm not sure what you're referring to, but I will graciously accept the compliment."
…
Barak prepared to transfer his unconscious friend--whom Euphen learned was named Egan--the two of them stood in strained silence, awaiting the next rotation of guards. Barak had snapped a pair of metallic rings around Euphen's wrists and ankles, explaining that, "Your circuitry will seize up if your heartrate passes a certain threshold; stay calm and you'll be fine."
Not that much of that meant anything to Euphen. He hadn't planned to be getting into much excitement in the foreseeable future, regardless.
 	Barak loaded Egan onto what Euphen recognized as a stretcher, albeit one levitating via magical means, then motioned for Euphen to follow. The replacement guards stood at attention, saluting Barak as the two of them passed by, Egan dragging behind them.
…
The twin gates began to shift, a cog in the center rotating slowly as sinuous lines of metal began to recede, the gates' constituent parts becoming increasingly distinct as they began to withdraw into the walls to either side. The sight revealed to Euphen was of a lethargic market, buyers shambling between degrading shacks stocked with deformed animal carcasses and misshapen tools.
 	"This must be the slums, then?" Euphen whispered to Barak. The man glared back at him but remained silent, then turned to face forward.
 	"This is the market."
 	"Why all the glum--" Euphen began, but cut off when Barak turned, glowering at him once more.
 	“If you’re truly from the Forest,” Barak growled, not bothering to face him, “I don’t know what protocol dictates.
	“You’d be quite an anomaly. None of the Outsiders have approached our barricades for quite some time--years, decades even.” Barak glanced back at him. “But you’d know that, considering you’re an Outsider, yourself.”
	Euphen leaned back slightly, pondering the question as he reached up to scratch his chin. The cuffs didn’t seem to be seriously prohibitive, but he wasn’t exerting himself.
	On one hand, people don’t tend to react positively when I explain I’m foreign to their reality...or perhaps “existence” is more accurate... Hmm…

…

They stood before a two-story building with an adjoining shack on one side.
	While the young guard gave a terse summation of his senior officer’s condition, Euphen surveyed his surroundings. About the stone structure, a few guards meandered. Dirty children scampered through the streets and alleys, hounded halfheartedly by a woman carrying tarnished leathers under one arm and a woven basket containing what Euphen supposed was fruit under the other.
	Not so unlike my old life, Euphen thought, smiling sadly to himself. Although, he continued, glancing about, things aren’t quite so primitive here.
	The buildings were crafted of an illuminous whitestone, although most were patched with a dull, grey mortar. Overhead, long rails ran parallel to the street, before splitting off to veer in different directions. Although they’d once been a sight to behold, the rails were now plagued with rust and greenery. Below the rails, the locals lethargically ambled by on walkways of whitestone, similar to the buildings but less luminous.
	Someone seized his arm--Euphen turned to find a displeased-looking Barak. It seemed to Euphen that his mood had darkened further since reporting to his superiors.
	“Tough being the low man on the totem pole, eh?” Euphen said with a smile he hoped was affable. The guard was neither negative, which Euphen had anticipated, nor positive; instead, he just looked confused. Damn idioms.
	Barak recovered, expression growing stern, and motioned with his free hand toward the door of the building. “In.”
	Euphen complied before the guard had another excuse to manhandle him.

	The wooden door swung open to reveal a small entryway, lit by a window on the opposite wall. Near the window there was a table which looked to have been carved from stone. Two men in guard uniforms sat at the table; one of the guards was leaning intently over a board on the table between them while the other was slouched in his chair, nonplussed. The guard leaning over the gameboard screwed up his face in concentration, hesitantly selected one of the smoothly-polished chips, then shook his head and replaced it.
	“Galen, Aetius, I have a prisoner detained from the Forest’s edge,” Barak said. The tense guard bolted upright, bumping the table and skewing the game board.
	“Aetius! Shackles!” The high-strung man, Galen, said. His eyes were slightly wild as they took Euphen in. The other man hadn’t moved; he spared his fellow a glare--which went unnoticed by Galen in his panic--before inspecting Euphen. He seemed unimpressed.
	“It’s your turn,” Aetius said, nonchalant. “Barry looks to have him in hand. And you’ve got a set to lose.”
	Galen spared one last look at Euphen, then sat down sullenly. Barak’s grip had loosened slightly on his arm, but the youth still seemed agitated. 
He seems generally displeased with the state of the Aegis. Now how can I use that to my advantage?
	Euphen turned to meet his eyes, to offer him a polite smile of commiseration. Barak’s expression regained its characteristic stoicism, and his grip tightened anew. Euphen shrugged inwardly.
	“Come on,” Barak muttered, towing him left toward a darkened archway, which gave way to a claustrophobic, staircase. The staircase was lit by spherical beacons, spaced what Euphen suspected to be a half-flight of the spiral staircase. Small passageways branched off from the staircase periodically. Euphen felt tension building as he waited for Barak to pull him through one of the narrow spaces--where they would undoubtedly be sealed in, trapped until their oxygen supply was exhausted and they suffocated, or a freak accident caused their tunnel to collapse, or an unknown beast was discovered to have burrowed in and had been waiting for prey…
	Hold steady. Worst comes to worst, you can step beyond this world and then... And then? He’d return exactly where he’d left, which meant any reprieve was temporary. And he would be a fugitive. No--it was better to stay and play this out, wherever came of it.
	“In here,” Barak said, indicating one of the passages, which seemed to Euphen indistinct from the rest. A sphere above the doorway lit in response to his raised arm, and Euphen felt a fragment of relief return with the illumination.
	He stooped, turning slightly to squeeze through the narrow doorway and into the suffocating darkness. Barak’s footsteps approached from behind, and threshold crackled a vivid blue. Sparks of light traced along tiny crevices in the wall, an ambient light drawing the room into a sharp contrast.
	The high ceilings belied Euphen’s expectations of a subterranean cellblock, but otherwise that was exactly what it was. Five cells lined each wall, separated by a corridor barely wide enough for two men abreast. The cells were cordoned off by a translucent material, akin to glass or crystal, but not fully either one. The light shone through, twisted and distorted to his eyes, and for a moment Euphen felt bile rise in his throat.
	“First on the left,” Barak said, pointing. He turned toward a pedestal to the left of the door, which had gone unnoticed by Euphen. With his index finger, Barak traced a series of symbols, illegible at this distance. Metallic grains rose to the surface, following the movements of his finger, as though it were magnetic. That done, Barak pressed his thumb against a circular node at the bottom right of the pedestal’s top. Euphen noticed a barely discernible tremor pass through the man, and when the thumb came away it left a red splotch of blood, which was drawn into the stone much as the metallic bits had emerged. Then the metal retreated into the stone, too.
	Euphen started at a humming sound behind him. 
A beast!? A cave-in?! He tensed, ready to bolt for the exit--but the sound was coming from the cell Barak had indicated. The crystalline substance shimmered and seemed to reverberate slightly from the center, as though a single pebble had disrupted its calm, liquid surface. Layers began to peel outward in waves, each pulse carrying sediments to the edges before returning inward.
	Wondrous… Euphen stepped forward, transfixed by the glow. Unbidden, the familiar melody played in his head, and he began to hum. 
The forest is peaceful at night, the stars overhead shine so brightly. The hunger recedes, slowly… And I am somewhere distant from this place. He reached up to his chest, fingers seeking the medallion. But there was nothing to grasp. His eyes refocused as attention returned to the present; the crystalline gap had grown sufficiently, and he stepped inside. 
Freedom relinquished.
	“So friend,” Euphen said, forcing a level tone, “what happens next?”
	Barak motioned, indicating Euphen’s hands, which he promptly raised.
	“An evaluation by an accredited physiker. If he certifies you, we’ll make inquiries and find a place to put you to work,” said Barak, reaching into the cell to grasp the straight bar linking the cuffs. They sprang open, and Euphen massaged his wrists. Despite that, they did not feel pained or sore; still, the habit had been ingrained during the many times he’d been arrested and bound.
	“But,” Barak continued, “that is assuming we find someone desperate or foolish enough to hire you.”
	“Or both,” Euphen replied cheerfully, before plopping backward unceremoniously and lifting his legs to Barak so those shackles could be undone as well. “It sounds like it will be easier to find work here than back home, since the work will be coming to me.”
	“An edge within sight is not yet underfoot,” Barak said, taking a step backward. He raised his right hand to the crystal at the edge of gap, and pressed his palm flat against it. Euphen could barely discern a cross-shaped scar, long-healed, in the center of his palm.
	Neither man spoke as life returned to the crystal, and it began to flow back toward the center in waves, sealing Euphen inside.
	Within the cube, Euphen could neither hear nor see anything beyond its scope. He sat down in the corner, settling in to wait.
…
	The orator at the front of the auditorium finished triumphantly, and the attendees erupted into rapturous applause. Euphen was certain he’d been listening intently, but found he was unable to recall a single word. He began to lift his hands, to join them in their celebration, but froze--
There is no reason for celebration, for self-indulgence. The thought came over him as though spoken aloud, wholly-formed but conveyed with a deliberate, patient cadence.
	Around him, others continued beating their hands together furiously. The cacophony reverberated in his ears, battering against his mind. Voices screeched with a passion somewhere between raucous joy and overzealous idolatry. Euphen felt an ephemeral separation between himself and those around him, which rendered him distinct, removed. The harmonies in his mind differed from theirs--from even the inanimate world which encapsulated them all--and the melodies clashed discordently.
	He discovered that their faces were all appeared shadowed, as though the light flooding through his eyes and into his brain yielded no lasting impression. 
Soon, this will end, and all will fade back into the darkness from which novelty emerges.
	“They will disappear, and only I will remain,” Euphen whispered to himself. The echoes of disharmony began to pain him, to plague him with their twisted familiarity.
	Indistinct words from the podium, and the crowd began to hemorrhage individuals, who broke away to flock toward the center aisle. Before he knew what he was doing, Euphen was stepping forward to join them in a single-file line. Progressing toward the figure at the podium.
The line moved slowly, then suddenly, as though governed byin time to an unknowableinaudible dirge. As he crept forward, Euphen scanned the crowd of shadows, all of whom wore the same uniforms as he. A muted shock ran through him as he noticed a few familiar faces interspersed in the homogeneity.
San’Illumin stood near the back, on a balcony upraised from the crowd of shadows--posture erect, hands clasped behind, with the expression of effortless condescension he so frequently affected. At his side was the young Lucen, doing his best to emulate his senior, but his expression was saddled with the brash, uncertain confidence of unproven youth.
From a balcony on the other side, Sir Ennis sat lounging, knowing eyes fixed on Euphen. He smiled slightly as their eyes met, a sight profoundly disturbing to Euphen for reasons he could not quite fathom; then the ageless man nodded, as though to prod him into action.
Euphen turned to find that the line had moved forward. Applause continued sporadically as each figure stepped from the head of the line, mounted the stairs to the stage, and then crossed toward the podium to meet the Orator. The Burning Star flashed through Euphen’s mind--a sharp, five-pointed star atop a fire with rounded tongues, set silver on gold. As the shadowed figures stepped forward in turn to meet the Orator, he took a badge from the podium, pinned it on the left lapel of the newcomer’s uniform, and then proffered his hand for them to grasp. A brief pause, as though both had forgotten what came next, followed by an outburst of applause to fill the caesura. And then the cycle began anew.
As the line inched closer to the stage, Euphen found himself fixated on the Orator. His features were hazy, rather than shadowed, to Euphen’s eyes. His hand shuddered uncontrollably when he reached out to grasp the next hand. 
An affliction beyond nerves and temperament. Even perfection decays.
As Euphen reached the front row, he found his eyes beginning to wander again. More familiar faces awaited him. Syxen stood with his shoulders slumped, clapping with enthusiasm that bordered on mania. As their eyes met, Euphen was overwhelmed by an internal tearing; the eyes of his former apprentice were glazed and unfocused. Dead. He tore himself away, attention alighting on another familiar face: Ellisia, the Maiden. Her skin was pale, as though her corpse had been drained of blood, but her eyes were fixated on him with piercing intensity. 
Those absent to us are dead, but those dead are not absent.
The audience was silent for one futile moment, and then another. Euphen had reached the front of the line, the pitch facsimiles waiting on him with bated breath. He turned to watch them, as they watched him. The instant hung, time complying with Euphen’s will.
The promised time approaches, heedless of your intentions. The thought radiated from the single figure on-stage.
And he could hear the melody again, embedded within the words and the resonance they carried. It seemed to envelope him, as though only he could interpret language.
Euphen smiled, a sense of divine peace settling over him. He turned, seeking the Orator, whom he knew to be the source of those words. The man had given him clarity; gratitude was the appropriate response.
As his eyes found the figure, a sense of instability rippled through him.
He looked at the Orator, and he looked upon himself--but older, wiser, and shrunken. Withered.
Euphen mounted the stairs with slow, heavy footfalls. The auditorium was silent, the tension weighing on his mind, whether real or imagined. His breath was labored.
Focus. Ahead.
The voice again. It sliced through the volatile air, dispersing the pressure. Still, he felt their unseen eyes on him as he stood atop the stage, level-footed with the Orator. Euphen stood nearly a head taller, but the urge to shudder and shrink away remained. He had the impression that the Orator was some grand impetus—as though he exerted an incomprehensible gravity by which they were all entrapped.
One step forward. Eyes fixed ahead. The air seemed to waver, the wind howling distantly. Euphen turned instinctively. His eyes fixed on a figure standing atop the railing of one balcony previously unoccupied. Euphen did not recognize him; a minor panic flashed through him. The young man slumped forward, casting his face in shadow, save his mouth. The edges turned upward into a twisted grin. His right arm rose to point at Euphen.
Peripheral motion drew Euphen’s eye. Shadows began to writhe throughout the twisted mass of bodies—slowly at first, then with increasing intensity.
Crushing weight returned to him at once; he scanned the balcony. Gone.
A sudden whistling; rushing air. Habit brought his right hand reached toward his hip. No weapons.
He stared across the stage; the Orator’s expression mirrored his own, a cocktail of desperation, confusion, and willful defiance.
The vibrations spread through the crowd like a plague; the nearest shadows began rushing forward. There was no outcry, just a deathly silence.
The medallion burned hot against his skin. Pain lanced through him. Then it was gone in an instant. Euphen relented and his skin began to peel away into flakes of ash, dispersed on a gentle breeze.
...
Euphen shuddered back to consciousness. Shadows and friends long gone... And the contents of his dream quickly followed, leaving behind a confused apprehension.
He looked up sharply, the luminous crystal entrance beginning to peel itself back. “...It’s a very atypical case, Second.”
“So you’ve said. And don’t call me that.”
The first voice was Barak’s, tentative yet insistent. His companion’s sounded weathered and irritable.
The pulsing waves swept translucence gradually outward, revealing the pair. Barak still wore the Aegis’ overcoat, a dull grey, but his underclothing was green, rather than brown. The man accompanying him was balding, slightly stooped, with a face with deep lines, as though he’d been born frowning and never  found a reason to change that. He wore a sweeping overcoat which had once been white, but was now stained with all manner of dull colors.
The old man eyed him meticulously, and Euphen returned his most affable smile. The old man snorted, then turned back to Barak.
“What’s special about this one? He looks the same as the rest of the damn scouts who wish they’d been born in the Forest.”
Euphen resented that. He’d tried hard to look like a wild forest dweller, an oddball who would stick out and attract attention no matter the circumstance.
“And you’re just a mad philosopher.” Euphen began.
The old man barked a laugh. “Well, I am mad, by all accounts. Invigorating to see that my reputation precedes me.”
“Sir,” Barak said hurriedly, “this one claims to hail from beyond the Forest.”
The mad philosopher’s laughter died immediately. His eyes lit with a ferocious curiosity, scrutiny redoubled, and the corners of his mouth turned downward, as though he were boring through a particularly impenetrable substance.
“Impossible,” the old man whispered. “You mean within the Forest? One of those man-beasts?”
“No,” Euphen said, rising. Barak recoiled, then brought himself to bear. The old man was unreactive, as still and solid as if he’d been wrought of stone.
“I am not of the Forest, nor am I of this land,” Euphen continued, undeterred by Barak. “In fact, the land of my birth is so distant I’d find no fault in you failing to conceive of it.”
He’d expected the old man to follow the line of questioning. He did not.
“How long were you in the Forest?” His tone was barely constrained, belying a fanaticism which took Euphen aback.
“Hours. Days, perhaps.” Euphen shrugged. “Tough to say.”
“How long have you been in this cell?”
“A day, perhaps less.” Euphen noticed he did not consult Barak, and that Barak did not intercede.
“Such should be insufficient for Dispersal...” He whispered, as though to himself. He turned back to Barak. “And he displayed no symptoms when you discovered him?”
Barak shook his head without looking away from Euphen.
The old man sidled up to Euphen with uneven steps, as though he’d recently lost weight.
“Pupils lack dilation,” he muttered to himself, leaning in closer than was comfortable. He raised his hand and snapped his fingers, forcing Euphen to blink.
“No tremors,” he continued, clasping Euphen’s forearm. Euphen successfully fought the urge to squirm away.
The old man released him and stepped away, turning to Barak.
“Well, he isn’t manifesting any of the expected symptoms,” said the mad scientist.
“Well,” Euphen replied with a grin, “isn’t that a rel--”
“But.” The old man said, holding up a finger. “He’s obviously mad if he believes himself to have lived outside this cage.”

...

The three men exited the cell block, Phaidros taking the lead while Barak crept along behind Euphen, as though he half-expected the Woodsman to flee down the spiral staircase and into the dark network of tunnels and caves.
The prospect made Euphen shudder; he felt compelled to speak, to shift his focus elsewhere.
“Old man--Phaidros,” he said, pausing to check if the others would insist on silence. Phaidros snorted, but Barak remained quiet. “You seem to know the Forest quite well,” Euphen continued. “Is your knowledge second-hand, or were you once a ‘fool adventurer’, too?”
The silence stretched, filling the darkness, juxtaposed against the clattering of leather boots against the stairs. Just as Euphen had given up hope of the conversation continuing, the sound of a sharp, deep inhalation reached him from ahead.
“I’ve seen both ends of it,” Phaidros growled softly. “Taken bad wounds, and treated worse.
“Lost friends… Been left for dead.” He stopped, standing with one boot on the next step. Behind Euphen came a scraping, followed by a guttural muttering he assumed was Barak swearing as he nearly lost his balance.
Phaidros turned and his eyes met Euphen’s; the gaze was such that neither could turn away.
“The Forest is death. And those who venture out into it deserve nothing less.”
“Does that include your young friend? The Hawk?” Barak mumbled sheepishly.
“Don’t bring him into this!” Phaidros roared, leaning around Euphen to glower at the guard. “He’s just another young fool, swindled into throwing his life away for a lost cause.”
“And if the cause is his choice?” Euphen asked softly. Visions of another young man, brimming with a single-minded conviction…
“I don’t give a damn if he wants to die,” Phaidros whispered furiously, “if he goes into the ground, I’ll rip him back out and beat the life back into him.
“I won’t let him throw his life away onoin pursuit of a fool’s errand. To this Forest, with its monstrosities and abominations, we’re just livestock--waiting to be butchered and eaten.”
“Would the Lost say the same?” Euphen mused, almost to himself.
In an instant, Euphen found himself pressed up to the wall with crushing force, Phaidros’ fists clenched like vices on his tunic. Even in the dim light, Euphen could make out the whites of his eyes, pupils shriveled and trembling with rage.
A pang of genuine fear pulsed through his gut.
“Don’t. Ever. Speak. Of. Them.” Phaidros barely managed the words through clenched teeth. Veins bulged in his neck, his knuckles white.
Then Barak was between them, pushing them apart and vainly attempting to wrench Euphen free of Phaidros’ grasp.
Euphen glanced back to Phaidros, who seemed to be struggling to regain control of himself. He said nothing, breathing deeply and rhythmically as he watched Euphen and Euphen watched him. Both refused to look away; Euphen did his best to project calmness.
“I apologize. I didn’t realize I’d I was touching a nerve.”
Phaidros said nothing, but he released his hold. Wordlessly, he turned and continued up the stairs.

Emerging back into the main room, Euphen was surprised to find the same two men seated at the table, playing the same board game as when he’d arrived. Seclusion isn’t good for me; without others around, my sense of time temporal perception tends to waver.
Phaidros moved to stand over them, ignoring the pair behind him. Barak motioned to Euphen, directing him down a hallway he’d missed previously. It led to a disorderly room, with stone blocks stacked atop one another. Blades of various sizes and shapes lined the wall, some even hanging from hooks trailing down from the ceiling.
Barak was evidently no longer in the mood for talking; he pointed to one of the nearer blocks, covered by relatively little dust. Euphen touched the top lightly, probing for some means of opening it. At his tap, a thin seam became visible on all sides, and the small portion above it rotated a quarter turn. The lid was a diamond atop the cube box; Euphen grasped the sides of it, lifting the stone tablet free. At once, the box’s inside lit, revealing his possessions, previously confiscated by the Aegis during his brief incarceration: his travel sack, a few bolas, his fur-lined overcoat, miscellaneous tools for trap-making, a dozen balanced knives, and his precious crossbow.
Armed, and feeling considerably more secure about his circumstances, Euphen shot Barak a grin. In return, the young guard’s expression became even stonier.
“Let’s go. The guildmaster is awaiting your arrival.”
Euphen made an unsuccessful effort to suppress a wider grin as he followed Barak back down the shadowed hallway. The only sound was of their boots tapping against the intricately-interwoven stonework underfoot, the rhythm irregular.
As they reentered the main room, a shout of indignation erupted from the table. Galen stood up, apparently moving to flip the board, but Phaidros held it in a place, a single hand pressed down, palm-flat. He glanced over his shoulder at Barak as he moved toward the door, then his eyes flicked to Euphen. The gaze held for a moment, then Euphen nodded in acknowledgement.
“‘Till next we meet, Phaidros,” he said, moving to follow Barak out the open door.
“You better hope that day doesn’t come too soon, Euphy,” Phaidros grumbled, mouth twisting into a savage grin.
The door closed soundly behind him as Euphen moved to join Barak.

The streets had grown more populous since he’d last walked them. Based on the position of the sun… I’d hazard a guess of four hours. Of course, it was impossible to say with any certainty until he gained more knowledge of this realm’s workings. That’s the trouble with going to an utterly new place. It’s never clear what has changed, and what remains the same.
The streets now teemed with life. Hunters dragging carts bearing their recent kills or farmers guiding livestock took right-of-way, lumbering through the streets’ middle. Everyone else moved along the sides, coursing around them without any pattern he could discern. People of all types carried all manner of goods: weapons, farming or smithing tools, fruits, meats, bundles of those unusual cylinders--both glowing and not--and dozens of other wares. Folk with beady eyes stumbled over children carrying bundles of food and paper. Aegis men, at the very least, seemed to command a level of respect; as Barak set out, bearing left down the street, a small pocket opened around him. Passersby nodded politely, and Euphen swore he saw the beginning of a grin on the guard’s face. A true man of the people, it seems, he thought, stepping quickly to follow in the parting wake.
“So,” Euphen began, raising his voice over the crowd’s ambience, “where is this guild hall, anyway?”
“You’ll see when we get there,” Barak said, continuing to stare straight ahead.
“If I’m to get settled in here, I’ll need to learn the lay of the land, sooner or later.
“I’ve always found the former to be preferable,” he asserted as politely as he could manage.
There was an exasperated grumbling from the man. Then, “It’s a red building, three stories, with a wide, sloping roof. About ten blocks ahead, then five off to the right.”
“Much appreciated,” Euphen replied over the crowd. While getting a grasp of the city’s size and scale will be vital, something tells me the magical barrier-forest is where I’ll find the answers I need.
[]
Up ahead. It was more instinct than thought. The crowd began to move irregularly, the berth granted to Barak narrowing gradually. There was a sudden order to the crowd, which had ceased to move in all directions haphazardly; instead, the tide of bodies began to press against them, as though fleeing from something ahead. The guard had also begun to adjust his course--slightly left, away from the street’s center.
“What’s ahead?” Euphen asked, leaning in closer to Barak. The crowd had hushed somewhat; there was no longer a need to raise his voice.
“The witches...” Barak breathed, as though to himself. He blinked, realizing to whom he’d been speaking. “Seers, I mean.”
“‘Seers…’” Euphen repeated slowly, sampling the unfamiliar word. “Who’re they? Everyone seems afraid. Even you.” An underworld organization, perhaps? Some manner of gang?
“No one knows.” Barak said, lowering his voice. They were drawing close now. “But they’re above the law. Their authority supersedes that of the Aegis.”
Interesting, Euphen thought, feeling the start of a smile. Very interesting.
Ahead and to the right, The crowd parted to reveal two figures in black, hooded cloaks which ran the length of their bodies. Their faces were concealed by white masks, smooth save for eyeholes, decorated with distinct, blue symbols unfamiliar to him. Apart from a nearly-imperceptible height difference and the different symbols, the pair was indistinguishable. All individuality hidden by the cloak and the mask. Assuming the masks are not personally bestowed, details of the eyes are the only means of identifying one from another. Assuming their eyes aren’t the same…
Barak changed course, continuing forward nearer to the left side. Euphen moved quickly, ducking to squeeze around to their right. He strode directly toward them to get a closer look. He felt Barak seize his arm, but Nature pulsed and he was free. The guard swore, and Euphen heard jostling behind, but he continued heedless. Time to make some friends.
The pair eyed him with undisguised contempt as he approached. Their eyes are the same blue, hard as ice and alien as the depths. Perhaps they differ in the irises…? But that was no good. The sun blazed hot overhead, the clear skies providing no buffer. Hidden in the shadows of their hoods, he’d been lucky to even see color.
Still, nothing to do but continue on his path. He approached the nearest figure, smiling broadly.
“Hello!” Euphen said jovially as he proffered his hand. “My name is Euphen Ryl--”
The black cloak shuffled, the folds of its cloth shifting slightly. His eyes narrowed instinctively, a flash of light glinting off metal.
Euphen immediately drew his Nature about himself; time seemed to slow around him.
The first thing he noticed as he glanced down was the knife. Its blade, wickedly curved and brighter than polished silver, carved through the air on its way toward his gut. What appeared to be a large, red stone was embedded in its guard, and its hilt radiated a familiar blue light around the fingers. Which, he was surprised to notice, look distinctly feminine. They were smooth and graceful, nearly pale in color, with nails painted black. Nail polish? Indicative of luxuries unavailable to the masses? But what’s this? The fingers’ pads, largely obscured against the dagger’s grip, looked hardened and worn. Quite the contrast, Miss.
But his time was nearing its end, the glinting blade approaching his chest.
Releasing hold of his Nature, Euphen moved quickly--leaning left, the thrust passing by. He glanced up, and was delighted to see her eyes widen with shock. He reached forward, seizing her outstretched wrist in his left hand and digging his thumb into the tendons of her wrist.
He was rewarded with a gasp as her grip went limp, releasing the knife to fall into his waiting right hand. And the chase begins. Turning first to waggle the dagger at Barak--That’ll learn ‘im--then spun on his heels, dashing for the nearest alley. The crowd parted around him, some scrambling away. Let’s see how fast you are.
Euphen's movements were sublime, if he did so say himself. My movements are sublime, he thought smiling to himself as he leaped over a series of wooden crates blocking the tight alleyway. As he cleared them, he kicked backward, gaining a small burst of speed and simultaneously creating another obstacle for his pursuer. And she was earning that designation, step-by-step.
Even with occasional bursts of Nature, she was doing a spectacular job of keeping apace with him.
He sprinted down the cramped alley, eyes ablur as he sought a means to reach the roof. If he could get up there, he was sure he could throw her off with some acrobatics. He followed the accessway as it curved off to the right, then ducked through an empty doorway. He pommel-horsed over the counter, the shopkeep's snarls barely registering in the back of his mind. Stairs... Ladders... Balcony?
He peeled out onto another thoroughfare, cutting left to hop onto a barrel, then springing off of that to seize the horizontal iron bar, from which hung the sign of the shop he'd just passed through: "Garil's Apothecary", which displayed a grinning man pulling the cork from a flask and its vapors swirling up into his enlarged nostrils. "Charming. Might have to swing by again when I have more time."
He hoisted himself up, then jumped to a nearby balcony of sturdy-looking wrought-iron. As he grasped the railing, he flinched at the piercing shriek of metal giving way. 
Shit, he thought, transfixed as the bolts binding it to the building started to squeal and bend. He quickly kicked against the ground, hopping up to balance precariously on railing as his world tilted increasingly sideways. As it reached a forty-five degree angle, Euphen made an explosive jump with all he could muster, seizing upon his Nature desperately.
He soared through the air, unfettered from gravity and undeterred by air resistance, grasping toward a sloping rooftop on the opposite side of the street. Physics began to reassert themselves, and Euphen could feel his Nature burning away, his potency leaching out. He released his Nature before it was all spent.
He crashed through the wooden window panels of the building's top floor. It seemed to give way almost immediately. Lucky it's not glass. Maybe if they were richer. But that seemed like small consolation. I amend that. Splinters are difficult to roll across.
He managed it, coming to his feet smoothly and turning to face her. Is that… Ice? It seemed like a little trail had followed him. As he watched, moisture in the air began to coalesce, quickly hardening along the splinters and along floors, forming patches of cold. Did she bring some water along for the trip? Unusual. 
And then she was there, a silhouette framed by the sun, perched on the sill like a bird of prey.
“Ah, hell.” Euphen reached, fumbling with his stolen knife, to grasp a pouch on his belt. With a sharp tug, it came free, leaving the divider hanging from its loop along his belt. He heard a subtle sizzling as the chemicals mixed into the herbs, then lightly tossed it toward her. His offhand held a throwing knife, drawn from behind the opposite shoulder. He weighed it idly, readied for the throw. You can never have too many knives.
The pouch rode its arc downward. He hurled the knife. They’ll reach as one.
Except his pouch did not release smoke as he’d intended. The sizzling fizzled, and the sack of chemical fell impotently at her feet. She reached up casually and caught the knife, snagging it from the air by its hilt. Oh.
“You see... ” He began as she threw his knife aside. It buried itself deep into a nearby desk. “Chemistry is one of those things that seems to vary a little bit, depending on where you are.”
His Nature enveloped him on instinct as the pouch exploded, setting fire to much of the floor, as well as several desks. 
Fire’s gonna spread, but that’s not the important part. Smokebomb! The Pouch’s contents streamed outward, spreading a heated fog throughout the workspace. He lunged through a window near the opposite end. It splintered similarly and he cast around, kicking against the window’s right side, angling leftward to snag a rung of the ladder to the roof.
He worked his way upwards, intermittently leaping from rung-to-rung, swinging over the top, moving to its leftward edge. 
I can see the red building from here. Let’s see if Barak properly interpreted my wink. He leaped across a few of the closer buildings, clustered oddly as they were. Then he waited for a moment, moving to hide behind a smokestack. There was a thumping, but it sounded almost distant. He chanced a peek. His former pursuer had followed him to the roof, and had her back to him as she whirled about furiously.
Euphen felt the weight of his ill-gotten gains, twirling her dagger between his fingertips. I wonder what secrets you hold? Its eye was the red stone, and it seemed to wink at him, spinning in the light as it passed through his fingers. It has a strange weight, but the balance is nice. How many of you Seers have these, I wonder. This, maybe others. Unique to you? Hmm... 
The thudding seemed to be getting further away. Another peak--and his unexpected donor was running out on him. The nerve of some women. She had settled upon a different path across the rooftops. What a strange district. And as two ships passing in the night, she is gone. Fare thee well, former-dagger princess. Time to go see this guildmaster. Maybe our good friend will be there.


	The street outside the tall, red facade of the guild was quite crowded. Euphen crouched, perched up four stories--the best view in the area--on the refurbished remains of a tower. From here, nearly everything nearby the guildhall was distinctly visible. Although reading lips at this distance would be tough, Euphen thought, squinting. It’d be very tiring to the eyes. The streets on either side of the hall’s block bustled with activity--carts dragged, children dragged--but much of it still seemed to be oriented around the hall, itself. One cart approaching the hall was stacked with corpses, its contents covered by a gigantic beast’s skin. Looks like a tiger of sorts, Euphen considered, stroking his chin. Some sort of overgrown cat, to say the least. Two of the other carts were cages, one which appeared empty while the other contained a group of small creatures--Feral chickens. Except they’re quadrupedal, and brown.
	All activity seemed to orbit the guild hall. The building was three stories high, its first two shaped from stone and finely detailed. Its top story was an apparent addition, composed largely from dull metal in conjunction with wood, less-masterfully shaped stone, and other various odds-and-ends. But the most important thing was that it was red. 
Not a very consistent paint-job, but points for artistry. Paint--or blood--was smeared across all visible surfaces of the third story.
	Both wooden stories had balconies extending along their lengths. Rapidly pacing along one side of the first story, Barak looked on the verge of panic. Eyes wide and occasionally muttered to himself, he continued back-and-forth across the deck, desperately searching the crowd.
	As far as I can tell, there’s no tail. Most of the obvious spots are visible from here. He doesn’t seem to favor any direction...which means it’s unlikely he’s aware of anyone. Still, best to go in from the back, get a good grasp of things, myself.
	Euphen disrobed, stuffing the fur-laced overcoat into his delicately-woven sack. Its bulk expanded slightly. I’ll need to acquire a disguise, soon. They’ll be hunting for me, in all likelihood. Superficial changes would be ideal, but...no razor handy.
	Peeking out from the cover of the alley, Euphen could see large throngs of folk off to his right, clustering on the street’s side opposite him. Some were audibly calling for guild attention: clarification on the status of a loved one, informal requests for supplies, or deliveries which required attention. A few mercenary scouts, easily distinguished by mismatched attire, were attempting to poach potential clients as they approached the hall. The hall itself was down the street to his right, then halfway down the block to the left.
	Trying to approach from its rear, Euphen exited the alley and wove through the teeming crowds to approach one of the nondescript alleys opposite. He wove his way carefully through the network of corridors, the space tight and tall enough that light was barely visible near the tops. []
	
Euphen stalked over the rooftops parallel to the guildhall, striving to remain hidden from Barak. He intended to ensure the man couldn’t betray him, even unintentionally.
Dropping to street level, Euphen wove through the teeming throngs, circling wide to subvert the guard’s gaze. He ducked into an alley which looked to lead to the guildhall’s back.
Stepping over a couple drunks--or their local equivalent--and squeezing between stacks of supplies, he came to the rear of the structure. Significantly less imposing from this side. Any details are impossible to distinguish with such little light.
Feeling his way along the smooth wall, Euphen’s fingers slid suddenly across cold metal; at the same time, he nearly tripped over a set of stone steps. Euphen stumbled, reaching down to catch himself. Creeping up slowly, he groped forward blindly until his fingertips touched the metal door. He fumbled for a handle or latch and found it on the right side. Euphen held his breath as he tugged gently, easing the door open to risk a quick peek inside.
Within was a large kitchen, populated generously with industrious chefs moving hurriedly between stations. A few stood off to the side, red-faced as they shouted orders. Runners sprinted plates back-and-forth between the common area and kitchen.
Ducking out before he was seen, Euphen used the tiny amount of light seeping out from the open door to survey the alley. The walls were narrow, the only other light shining from above. Most of the sunlight is probably blocked by the third story. Only the edges near the top are illuminated--
His thoughts were interrupted by a crashing sound from the kitchen, which was shortly followed by several distinct instances of shattering glass. Euphen’s mouth went dry, but its edges turned up in the beginnings of a grin.
He scrambled to the left of the door even as it opened, emitting light into the alley. A short woman wearing a chef’s full-body smock. Hounded by curses, she looked on the verge of tears in the faint light. With one hand she held a metallic tray  horizontally, balanced against her body; with the other, she reached down to her waist.
As the door swung shut slowly and they were gradually plunged back into darkness, a tiny ball at the chef’s belt came alight--a soft blue which pulsed rhythmically. With each pulse, the light became brighter, stabilizing into the steady light of lantern.
The chef huffed, muttering furiously to herself as she moved to dump the contents of the tray into a larger bin Euphen had passed by earlier. Euphen slunk backward cautiously, eyes darting around in search of a place to hide. The stacks of refuse were either too short or too narrow, and there wasn’t another bin or similarly-large object within his sight. I don’t want to cause a commotion here, and sneaking in unobtrusively through the kitchen is untenable.
Should I climb? I would need her light…
For her part, the woman stood for a moment, peering down into the bin she’d just filled. She howled--causing Euphen to jump involuntarily--half in anger and half in despair. Then she spun, stalking back toward the door.
Euphen dropped flat, pressing himself against the ground and clutching his Nature tightly. Colors distorted around him, the light swallowed by his presence. The waves became visible to him, and time slowed ever so slightly. Glancing up toward the oncoming pulses, Euphen saw the woman approach the door, reaching out to grasp the handle. With a deep breath, he crept to his feet patiently, so as not to draw her eye.
She swung the door open, breaking line of sight.
He darted forward, each step carrying him three strides forward.
His fingers were closing around the ball swinging at her belt from a tiny chain. She was stepping forward; the door was closing.
She would think it snagged on something; he would have half-a-second to dive around the door as she reopened it.
He dropped his Nature; he’d need it again, soon.
At his touch, the ball came fully alight. Huh. That’s unexpected.
She spun, her eyes meeting his. She opened her mouth.
“Eh--” He started to say.
And then he lifted a leg and kicked her square in the gut. The small chain snapped, and Euphen was left clutching the ball.
The woman grunted, sprawling backward as the door shut.
They’ll probably stop to check if she’s alright, then pursue me. Three seconds before this alley is swarming with guild members.
The light pulsed in his hand.
“Flames guide me,” he muttered in his native tongue. Father’s adage.
He sprinted toward the disposal bin. He opened his hand, allowing light to emanate through his fingers. A small outcropping became visible where the first story met the second. He hopped atop the bin, hoping it would bear his weight without toppling, and then soared with a Nature-enhanced jump. He snagged the outcropping with his left hand, the light still brilliant in his right.
Euphen glanced down at the ball in annoyance, then opened extra-wide and stowed it between his teeth. The ball wasn’t small enough for him to close his mouth around it, but it stayed put.
Scrambling upward desperately--his time was almost up, and he could hear a new rattling emanating from the kitchen. Sounds like they’ve taken their time scrounging up some support. He swung his leg over the ledge; there was barely enough room to stand with his back to the second story wall.
The door below banged open. Euphen tapped the lightball with his tongue, but its illumination did not diminish. He reached up quickly, prodding the ball with his finger.
Darkness enveloped him as the alleyway lit below. The cries rose to a fever pitch as guild members flooded the alleyway, convening briefly before surging through the cramped space in both directions. Euphen held his breath and closed his eyes, wishing to melt into the stone against his back and become part of it.
The shouts faded as the figures rounded the corners onto the streets, dispersing into the crowd. He opened his eyes. The sunlight peeked over the edge of the rooftop above. Turning, Euphen began working his fingers along the wall, seeking any slight grooves or outcroppings. The building had been seamlessly carved or shaped from hardened mud and stone.
Sheer. That will make climbing nearly impossible. Euphen

## History

Born as the product of decades of breeding, Adam is the perfect conduit for Exousia. Experiments with Lione and her ilk were attempts to recreate him more reliably and to mass-produce him. Adam is able to traverse the Disruption without adverse effects.
As such, Adam is under tremendous pressure to become leader his father wants him to be, and is his father's backup for godhood.
From a young age, Adam has been trained to be a ruthless and fearless leader, but he was never properly loved. As such, it is the one thing he secretly craves.

# Arc
Adam's arc is about him gaining independence from his father and realizing that he can have his own goals and aspirations.

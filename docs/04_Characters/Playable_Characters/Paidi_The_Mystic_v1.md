## History
[Following their expulsion from Kuklos Anankes, the Order of Pious Sun](https://www.notion.so/The-Order-of-Pious-Sun-WIP-69a06a9c90154df98e9d2658d1c1dabd?pvs=21) existed in relative isolation for over a century. As a child, Paidi was exuberant and talkative.

- Paidi has a happy childhood.
- Paidi is a gifted healer.
- Paidi does not get along with other women.
- Paidi is extremely energetic, outgoing, and is popular with men.
- Paidi seeks adventure and excitement, and escapes the confines of the village to explore Kuklos.
- She is spotted by Cyrus (how and why?) and they track her back to their village.
- Now that the secret is out, the Collective wipes out the village to prevent its existence (and the repressiveness of the Forest) from being known.
- Paidi is regretful and turns to alcohol to forget her troubles.

A metaphysical wound created by the inciting incident--the Disruption.

Like a physical wound, it heals from the outside in, the power of Exousia gradually converging to its epicenter. It has several layers.

## Layer 0: The City

## Layer 1: The Forest

## Layer 2:

## Layer 3:

## Layer 4:

## Layer 5: The Outer Ranges

Home of the Outsider Tribe. Because they originally hail from snowy-peaks but their genetics have been diluted by forced breeding, the land is not completely reflective of their original heritage.

## Layer 6:

## Layer 7: The Rotten Bone Graveyard

Perpetually overcast and dour.

One visual reference is from the beginning of the Alters--the first overlook of the mobile base paints a picture.

## Layer 8, 9: The Desert

All else equal, given enough time the land will revert to its natural state and ownership. Enough time has passed that the two outermost layers of the Wound have become desert-like.

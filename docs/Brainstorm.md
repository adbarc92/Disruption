Iteration 1:
- FFX Turn Order
- 

Final Fantasy X
- Soft ATB: Skills essentially have weights that delay your next action and MP costs
- Overdrive: customizable super move, varies by character

Expedition 33
- Skills have AP Cost (unspent is conserved)
- Attacking and starting your turn grant some AP

Persona 5
- Single turn
- If you hit an enemy weakness, they are knocked down and you get another turn

Darkest Dungeon
- Turn order based on speed
- Single action

Divinity 2
- AP
- 

Disruption Philosophy: Mobility, Meaningful, Heroic/Struggle, Preparation
- Enemies should try to ruin your positioning
- "Defend" command should be valuable but not dominant
- How many actions per turn? Should you be able to move and attack? Should you be able to hit-and-run?
- Should using an item be a whole turn?

A few thoughts about Disruption and Tempests

Tempests is a modern, masculine fairy tail. It has touches of science fiction, but it is ultimately supposed to be inspirational. It is about one boy's struggle to find a place in this world, and how his triumph and sacrifice leads to a new golden age for mankind, as well as the throwing off the shackles of a parasitic, hidden society.

Disruption is also about resisting a hidden society, but on a much smaller and focused scale.

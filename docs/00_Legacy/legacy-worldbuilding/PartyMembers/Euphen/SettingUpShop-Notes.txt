Giuseppe's Feedback - Euphen

	* The Forest is a violent place.
	* Some moment in the dead zone. A giant monster confrontation.
	* Walls are largely cobb construction--molded stone?--but can be reinforced from other places.
	* Euphen's labels of people are charming to Giuseppe
	* Older guard are put out to pasture when 
	* Attitudes toward Devices by the Public: they are heavenly gifts when used by authority, but are not to be questioned and tampered with. Their existence eclipses human comprehension.
	* Relations between the Outsiders and the Public: they are known, they are boogie-men; human-esque 
	* Glowing Stones
	* Giuseppe likes the litte bit about the woman being pestered by children
	* Idioms are tricky; must be pithy, and strange. "Not out of the Forest yet."
	* Within the dream--shadowed faces become distinct and recognizable. Euphen is surprised by it? The reader must understand that this is intended.
	* "Lot's of different "
	* Dispersal is the formally-used term
	* The nature of Euphen's intelligence. Way of speaking?
	* The chase feels interesting, Giuseppe really likes it
	* Euphen's powers being seamlessly explained is good--like Lift's introduction.
	* Add paragraph breaks before all thoughts, as though they are speech.
	* 

	* Self Notes:

* On the other hand, the sense of power and accomplishment can often be associated with larger increases in damage values, and when you see that your health has been increased by an order of magnitude, the player feels hardier.

* Is it simply a matter of average damage numbers per round? Is that what balance is? 

* Accomplishment can be derived from two places in this genre: preparation and combat innovation.

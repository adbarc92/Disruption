**Story**

At the end of the prior age, one of violence and bloodshed, the Aeonic counsel manifests and meets on a rooftop to determine the Dominant of the new age. In their grand game, Wisdom has accumulated greatest success among her adherents, and will lead the new age to begin.

After a thousand years, a new metropolis rises in the middle eastern, sand-ridden continent: 

From the beginning, Cyrus seeks to explore the unknown and return home. He believes that he has been transported to some other reality and that if he tries hard enough, there is a way to go home (Tidas). At first, he is willing to work with the locals in their expeditions. Although Cyrus has limited martial experience, he is the sort to lead from the front and throws himself quickly into adventuring. 

**Gameplay**

The core gameplay loop should be: explore the Unknown to acquire wealth and materials ⇒ use the resources to expand your powers

Battles should be extremely challenging and involved. Resource management—both macro and micro—will be a core component of the game. The homebase should feel simultaneously safe and unsettling. Penalties for failure should be meaningful and severe—saving in the outside world should be limited.

The scouting party can consist of up to three characters (rationale?). One must be named, the others can be hired. The death of a named character results in a game over. 

There are a few important core gameplay loops to consider:

1. Unknown traversal
    1. Combat: takes place on two 3x3 grids. 
        1. Turn-based
    2. Unknown Exploration: plan expeditions, deal with logistical challenges
2. Small map traversal: walk around the world, 
3. Base building

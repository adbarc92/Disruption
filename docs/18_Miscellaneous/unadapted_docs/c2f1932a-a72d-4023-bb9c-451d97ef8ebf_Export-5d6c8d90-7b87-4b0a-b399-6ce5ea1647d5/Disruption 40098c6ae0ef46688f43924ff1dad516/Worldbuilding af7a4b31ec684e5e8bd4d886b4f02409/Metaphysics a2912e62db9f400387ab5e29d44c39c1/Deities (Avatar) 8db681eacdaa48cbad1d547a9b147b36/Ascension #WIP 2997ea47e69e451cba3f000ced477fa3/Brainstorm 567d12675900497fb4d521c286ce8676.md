Ascension:

How does Ascension occur?

Sacrifice, which means the cross.

The Eclipse.

Gathering of Sacred Relics.

Arrival at a metaphysical crossroads.

The proper time

An invitation from a retiree.

Force a divinity to manifest, and then slay them.

P5 Yaldobaoth: people yielded their desire for free will.

# Aristotlean Virtues

*Authored: 2019-04-04*

Prelude: Within the Schíma tou desmoú (Σχήμα του δεσμού), there are two primary groupings of Dídagma (Δίδαγμα): those who uplift, and those who degrade. This dichotomy was found to be necessary by those who Fabricated the First Conditions, the initial principles upon which reality was founded; none could be uplifted without the context of those who would cause degradation. Both elements are present to varying degrees in humanity.

Initially, only those who uplift were Seirá (Σειρά), while those who degrade were Cháos (Χάος).

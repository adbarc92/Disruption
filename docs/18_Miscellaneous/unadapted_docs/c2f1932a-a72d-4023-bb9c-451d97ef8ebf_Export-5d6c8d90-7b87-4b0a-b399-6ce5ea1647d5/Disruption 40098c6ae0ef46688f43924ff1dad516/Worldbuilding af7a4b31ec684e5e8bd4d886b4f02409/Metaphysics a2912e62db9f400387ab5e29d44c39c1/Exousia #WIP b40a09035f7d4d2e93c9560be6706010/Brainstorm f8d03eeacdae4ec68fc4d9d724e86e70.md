# Brainstorm

The metaphysical fabric of the universe, manifested in a number of different ways. While magic suffuses the world to a certain degree, it is particularly vibrant within humans, who can use their conscious minds to guide it. The list below details the existing categories of Exousia application, but is always subject to expansion. Because each category is derived from a different "deity" not all magics are equally viable at all times and in all places; viability is essentially limited to the extent of a source god's degree of metaphysical influence. Affinities for different categories of magic vary significantly between individuals, some times resulting in anamolous powers called "quirks" or "knacks."

- Foresight: Abilities relating to the reading of causality's flow. Strongly related to logic and reasoning.
- Elemental (Classical): The ability to manipulate the classical elements--earth, water, air, and fire.
- SpaceTime: Abilities relating to the creation of pocket dimensions, as well as compressing or expanding time's passage.
- Conduits and Alignment are part of the same power set: Shaping
    - These have been segregated into two power sets in accordance with the Capital-Labor dichotomy.
    - Conduits: A biologically-deviant aligner whose magical vessels have grown porous (inbreeding is one cause of this); this allows the user to embed fragments of one's magical engine--their metaphysical "soul"--into objects. This is the only means of creating self-activating objects. The essential instability of Conduits impairs their ability to properly guide the flows of magic; thus, even the proper inscription of runes fails to metaphysically alter the object, and the Exousia cannot flow along the desired channels (resulting in destabilization of the object). Because Conduits have historically commanded tremendous social clout, they consider it beneath their station to breed with common Aligners.
    - Alignment: Abilities related to inscription and runic language, allowing one to impart magic and/or will to inanimate objects.
    - Glyphein: The offspring of a proper Conduit with a common Aligner. Quite rare and highly stigmatized.
- Stance: Abilities derived from the combination of one's body with the environment
- Reinforcement: Abilities relating to the manipulation of one's body. Strongly related to emotion. Berserker rages is an application of this. Intellectual cultures consider this category to be cursed.

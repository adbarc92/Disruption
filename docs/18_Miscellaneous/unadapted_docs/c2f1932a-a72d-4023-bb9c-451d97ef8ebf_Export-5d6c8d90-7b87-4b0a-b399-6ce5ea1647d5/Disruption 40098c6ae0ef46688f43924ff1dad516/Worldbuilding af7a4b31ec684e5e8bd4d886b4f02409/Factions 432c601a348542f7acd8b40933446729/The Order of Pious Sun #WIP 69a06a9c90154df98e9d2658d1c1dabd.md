# The Order of Pious Sun #WIP

One of many religious orders from old Kyanosian culture. Scapegoated and driven from the Kuklos Anankes over two centuries ago.

Two centuries ago, the Order of the Pious Sun was under persecution by the Collective after the most recent expansion of the Forest. Under the leadership of [Batuo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batuo), the Order made their way out through the Forest and into the Swamp, where they settled into a small village. Eventually, they dug out the swamp and fortified walls with rock provided (in exchange for martial and spiritual teachings) by the Vanar, eventually migrating most of their village beneath the swamp. Only accessible by a door embedded in a nearby giant tree that leads down through the tree roots, their village remained hidden until five years before the story began.

Somewhat unknown to the group, the only thing that prevents them from succumbing to the madness of the Forest is that they travel in a sufficiently large group that they can mitigate it.

History:

The Order of the Pious Sun originally possessed knowledge of the Sacred Son who crafted reality. They worshipped his trait of piety, embodied in his daughter, Sophia. Eventually, this became corrupted and they worshipped the Sun.

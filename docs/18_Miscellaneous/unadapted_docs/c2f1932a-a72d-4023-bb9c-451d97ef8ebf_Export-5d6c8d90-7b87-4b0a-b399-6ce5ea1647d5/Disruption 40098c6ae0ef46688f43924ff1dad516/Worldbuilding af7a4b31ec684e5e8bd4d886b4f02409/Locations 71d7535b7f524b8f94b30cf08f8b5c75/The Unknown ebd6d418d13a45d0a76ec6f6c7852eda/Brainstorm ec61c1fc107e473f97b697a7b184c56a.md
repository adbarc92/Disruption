- Confirmed Layers
    - The Liminal Zone
        - First zone
        - Small (~1mile)
        - Dead zone/weak monsters, wanderers, etc.
        - Paidi’s temple
        - Rare strong monsters
    - Spirefall (or, “Mother’s Teeth”): a giant,
        - A petrified zone in the Forest where jagged spikes rise from the ground; completely comprised of stone and earth
        - Massive, massive redwoods; appear as mountains in the distance
    - Disruption’s Shell (or, “Void”), Layer [Ultimate]
        - Smoke from Perdition’s Fires fill the skies, even as the Forest’s trees are no more. Wide, blazing trunks gradually give way to an open meadow, disturbingly idyllic. The grass is bright green, gleaming with morning dew, and the skies above are overcast with rain clouds, rather than smoke. Tempests converge on the horizon, forming a formidable storm which trails an obscurance--neither quite fog nor quite mist--into the air. The fields of grass sweep far and wide, rising into tiny hills and sliding into small valleys; flowers of all (natural) shades are scattered liberally throughout.
        - Anyone who has departed to venture out through the Fog is never seen again. The number of parties who have accompanied or escorted an adventurer to the Fog and witnessed their departure can be counted on one hand; only half of these groups are alive. They have usually settled somewhere within the Forest, in one of the few places which are habitable for non-adapted humans--such as the edges of safe Layers--where social interaction is limited. These few individuals have grown apart from society, either in demeanor or deformity, and seem to find the Forest more hospitable.
        - Even adventurers who deliberately ventured limited distances have been lost; as soon as they pass beyond sight, they disappear.
    - The Crest (or, “Graves”), Layer 4
        - The Crest is the Fourth Layer; thinner than its brethren, it is an oddity even in the Forest, for its plains are flat and barren, apart from a few lone trees, each withered and skeletal. Plants cannot grow here, for nearly every available patch of ground has been appropriated for burial, and some plots appear to be recent additions. This Layer’s only residents drift throughout it as ghosts, humanoid figures wearing cloaks of mottled gray, disappearing near the edges of sight. Some doubt their existence, but among experienced Explorers they are referred to as “The Disciples of the Circle,” even though they’re usually uncertain as to its meaning. Some claim to have seen them drifting across the enormous graveyards as though on currents of air, placing small statues of stone rings onto plots with fresh soil.
    - The Caustic Rise (or, “Silent Reckoning”), Layer 3
        - The Grave is largely the result of the Third Layer--a zone of insidious death. Many aspiring, promising adventurers have passed through the area, reveling in the thrill of exploration, only to later succumb to one of nature’s slow, subtle poisons--which had unbeknownst to them, crept through their veins through knicks and scratches--unnoticed in their haste.
        - The few who manage to survive its environment almost invariably become prey of its occupants: the Tainted, monsters of many sorts who share their Layer’s curse. Wary visitors draw an especially vicious ire because fresh meat tastes particularly delicious when dissolved in the stomach acid of these monsters. They have grown accustomed to butchering live flesh, but have no prescient or supernal sense for it. They are, however, drawn to the scent of fresh blood and become infuriated if denied its taste after detecting it nearby. Consequently, this can be avoided as long as one does not shed blood to open air in the Third Layer.
        - Regardless, carrion is plentiful; the many pools of glowing groundwater are littered with bloodied clumps of meat and bone, former remains of foolish beasts and impulsive humans...or their willfully surrendered limbs. The toxins of this Layer are lethal beyond a dozen scratches, assuming maximum resilience and tenacity; as a result, many limbs have been left behind by those of sufficient pragmatism.
        - The final important characteristic of the Third Layer is that its Hindrances tend to converge as travelers near its outside edge. This is to say that beasts pursue more aggressively and environmental hazards--such as puddles of acid, barbs and thorns, and motion-responsive plants--are concentrated more densely. It is as though the Layer acts as one to ensure that all foreign matter within is dissolved, and it is imperative that none escape.
        - Traversing this area requires Heavy Robes, to prevent the smell of blood from attracting the beasts;
            - Heavy Robes grant 100% bleed resistance at the cost of -50% speed

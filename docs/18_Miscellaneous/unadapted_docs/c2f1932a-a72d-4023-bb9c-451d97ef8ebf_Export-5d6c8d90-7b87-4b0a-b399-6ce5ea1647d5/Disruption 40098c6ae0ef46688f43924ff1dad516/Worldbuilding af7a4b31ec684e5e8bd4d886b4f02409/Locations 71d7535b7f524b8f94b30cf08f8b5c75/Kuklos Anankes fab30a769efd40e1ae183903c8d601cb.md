Literally translated: “City of Fate”

The main setting of the story. Following the Disruption, Kyanos is renamed to Kuklos Anankes, commonly called “Kuklos”.

 Kuklos is rimmed on all sides by a vast forest and very few know what lies beyond. Most of the runic and metaphysical knowledge has been lost, and the civilization has largely been reduced to nearly-agrarian levels of advancement, technology, and prioritization. A large chunk of the remaining cityscape has been repurposed for farming. Dedicated groups track, hunt, and trap within the forest, but much of the meat has been mutated beyond safe eating. The populace knows how to create pottery and clothes as well as work metal. The entire economy revolves around the forest, as that is the only well-mapped layer of the Disruption, and Kuklos is isolated from the rest of the world. Many districts of Kuklos suffered immense structural damage and have been deemed virtually uninhabitable by the government. A few ne'er-do-wells skirt these restrictions, and certain districts hide secrets that are protected by lethal force. Devices are now considered anathema by the general populace, largely due to an effective propaganda campaign by the Collective. The environment has dramatically changed since it was Kyanos. The metaphysics shifted in the surrounding areas to account another principality—Vitality. The surplus of vitality has caused the area to shift. Souls in the area nearby have continued to be born with the principality of Wisdom, which leaves them at odds and causes unmitigated growth within the Wise, which causes cancer proliferation and insanity.

- Weaponry: primitive weaponry has been developed. Metalworking is well-established, but without the advent of explosive powder, firearm breakthroughs have been slow. Use of Devices as weapons has been stigmatized, and only unconventional adventurers are willing to resort to them.
- Walls: large, robust fortifications have been created on the border of the forest. Because the forest is encroaching, every two centuries the walls need to be rebuilt.
- Culture:
    - Clothing:
        - Near forest: Temperate to high-desert feel, depending on region. Clothing focus is relatively loose and flowing.  Clothing skews towards sumerian, egyptian, and greek-but with a good helping of traditional “fantasy” garb. Adventure/guards more generalized. Leathers, metals, and magitech. Hodgepodge.
            - Reference: Miyazaki work, esp. Civilian clothing from Nausicca.
        - More interior farming classes: Western rainforest feel, more traditional “pastoral” areas. Mix of European clothing, Chinese/Japanese and traditional fantasy garb.
        - Larger cities (and the wealthy-to-rich): Victorian style clothing and more modern styles, mixed with eastern flares.
    - Drugs
    - Instruments
    - Ceremonies

# Cyrus, the Seeker

**Background**

- Cyrus is eminently practical and has little regard for the arts.
- Cyrus has a respect for history and tradition, and is well-versed in his heritage and culture.
- The Outskirts are a home for the former desert people
    - Name of the people?
    - How were they pushed out?

Born in the Outskirts to an impoverished family, Cyrus knows what it is to bleed and struggle.

Cyrus comes from a proud desert people—warriors who lived on blood and water. He felt comfortable in the sands, and accompanied his father on many trips outside the city when he was young. He was familiar with the Giri and their culture, and respected them immensely.

He learned Aligning in hopes of lifting his family out of poverty. Cyrus comes from a big family, with two brothers and two sisters. He is the second oldest. His older brother was to follow his father into their trade. Cyrus was always quick and clever, having inherited his mother’s wits and father’s tenacity, and so did the most profitable thing his talents could afford, becoming a Rune Builder.

He is a Glyphein, his mother a Source and nomadic artisan who abandoned her wealthy family to live in poverty with a desert savage—Cyrus’ father, who has unexplored talents in Guiding. Cyrus’ interest is financial and practical first, and theoretical second, which means he is largely uninterested in the art of Realization—the discovery of new Runic symbols.

~~He appreciates the strategy involved in some forms of recreation in Kyanos, but has no care for them beyond that.~~

~~He appreciates music as an engineering achievement.~~

Cyrus is quite curious and nonjudgmental. He is exceedingly rational, and irrational people are a nuisance to him.

He has little taste for women. His older brother was indulgent, and Cyrus judges women to be a distraction.

Cyrus cares about freedom. He dislikes how poverty prevented his family from being able to live as they want, and feels for the people of Kuklos in that.

Cyrus has always had trouble getting close to people. He felt his family understood him and that was enough.

Cyrus is pragmatic to a fault, and has learned to divorce himself from his emotions and push through pain. He values results above all else, and does not compare himself to others, which has led to tension with his more competitive peers in the past.

**In-Game:**

After escaping the Disruption, Cyrus starts out by seeking information regarding his environment and a way home. Cyrus starts out having issues trusting anyone around him. He has no idea what is going on, where he is, or why he is there. But generally speaking, he maintains his seriousness, focus, and pragmatism in the face of difficulty.

In truth, he is desperate and lonely. He lost everything he had—his family, friends, career, and culture. He has been reduced to zero, only having his wits and muscle on which to rely. Deprived of his family, he feels completely lost. He would give anything to have them back.

When he realizes he cannot get home, he has a dark night of the soul. He wants to give up, but his rationality pushes him forward. He has gradually learned to lean on his new family, and resolves to free Kuklos from the tyranny of the Collective and the Unknown, so they can live proper lives.

Alternatively, he is tempted by the prospect of seizing control so that he can be the one to force freedom upon them.

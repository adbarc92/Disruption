Read Plato’s Phaedrus. Beneath it all, Phaidros is a wounded artist. His craft is his life. He does not truly care about the Unknown. Those are just logistics.

**Background**

Born before the seizure of the Nous district, Phaidros was born to an intrepid Legionnaire and his paramour, a budding scientist. He lived his life seldom seeing his father, who was frequently called upon for subduing riots among the populace. Phaidros, or Dro, as he was known in childhood, grew up primarily in the lab under the supervision of his mother. While she studied all manner of things, her primary fascination was with Exousia, and she supported herself and their family by applying it in the context of the military and violence. She always aspired to a more pure and peaceful application of scientific practice, but circumstances prevailed over ideals. Dro’s mother was also involved in the instantiation of Project Eudaimonia, intended to create a human body that could perfectly handle Exousia, one result of which would ultimately be Lione.

Dro’s father was not completely uninvolved in his life. Periodically, when he could take leave, Dro’s father would escort him in secret through secluded parts of the city. While stern and intense, Dro’s father would sometimes speak of his dreams—order restored to the city, the Corruption beaten back, and the Outsiders destroyed. Growing up, Dro had somewhat mixed feelings about his partly-estranged father, but above all he longed to help the man with his dreams and make him proud.

A few years later and as Dro nears the end of his adolescence, his mother regrets her involvement in the Eudaimonia project and releases a few of the children. Not only are the children rounded up, but Dro’s mother is set to be executed. Dro’s father attempts to intervene on grounds of injustice, and the two of them are killed. Dro has begun his studies at the Nous Symposium, and remains unaware of any of these goings on until it is too late. He swears vengeance against the Collective, and begins growing suspicious of bureaucracy, generally. He maintains his father’s loyalty to the people of Kuklos, as well as his hatred toward the Outsiders.

Many years pass, and Dro becomes Phaidros. ~~He has risen up the ranks, albeit not as quickly as he otherwise would, as his fellows are from noble or well-to-do families while Phaidros has had to make his own way.~~ ~~He has secretly continued his mother’s research, while supporting himself as an underground boxer among the soldiers and Venturers, where he meets Vaughn’s father.~~

He has succeeded in the Symposium, joining the upper echelons of pupils, while also competing in an underground boxing club, something which causes him internal conflict at times, as it represents an internal contradiction between the desire for order and appreciation for martial prowess, both of which he’s inherited from his father.

Unfortunately, Phaidros’ scholarly and pugilistic worlds collide unexpectedly when his competitor for a research position reports him to the Symposium’s board for conduct unbecoming of a scholar—his underground boxing. Phaidros is allowed to graduate, but does so without distinction or honor. Thereafter, he is invited by Vaughn’s father to join them as a Venturer, which he grudgingly accepts. Shortly after this, the Nous district is cordoned off by authorities and its residents are required to resettle in Anthropos.

**Demeanor**

Phaidros is extremely protective of Vaughn, but is generally closed off to other people. He responds well to scientific inquiry and curiosity, but has little to do with others on any purely social basis and would usually prefer to work in his lab. He enjoys experiments, fighting, and smoking his pipe. He dislikes small talk, stupidity, incompetence, and tyranny. He generally communicates gruffly and frequently grunts. His lab is a mess, but the rest of his small residence is neatly organized. He likes cooking, as he finds it resembles chemistry, which he also likes, although he rarely has people to cook for. He bears grudges against the government and the Symposium leadership, although he is quite well-respected among journeymen at the latter. He is very diligent, and always does his chores before relaxing. His dream is a synthesis of his parents’: he longs to find a way to restore order and stability to Kuklos, and seeks to harness Exousia to do so. He theorizes that it should be possible to create collectors that gather the energy from the air and then transmit it into the city, but has so far been unable to make this work.

**Arc**

His character arc will involve the struggle accorded to his namesake in the Platonic dialog: the struggle of the rational against the emotional. Phaidros has a lot of rage and wants revenge against many people, and depending on the actions of the player, he may fall in love with Paidi, who aggressively and then tentatively pursues him over the course of the game, or become more hardened in his ways and devote himself entirely to science.

**Relationships**

Vaughn: After the passing of Vaughn’s parents, Phaidros became a begrudging mentor figure to him. As Vaughn got older, Phaidros started to lean on Vaughn as his last consistent human connection, and their father-brother relationship evolved into one of mutual respect and reliance. Vaughn still asks Phaidros for advice.

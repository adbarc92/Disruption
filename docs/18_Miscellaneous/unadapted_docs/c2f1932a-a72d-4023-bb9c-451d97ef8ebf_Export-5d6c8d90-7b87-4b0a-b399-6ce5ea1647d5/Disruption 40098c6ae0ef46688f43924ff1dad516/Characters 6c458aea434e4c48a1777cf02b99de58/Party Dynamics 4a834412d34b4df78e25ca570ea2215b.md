# Party Dynamics

# Pairs

**Cyrus and Vaughn**

Brothers in arms, united by a shared interest in understanding the world around them. They always have each others’ backs. Thick as thieves. Usually, Cyrus concerns himself with logistics while Vaughn provides the vision and charisma to make things happen.

**Cyrus and Phaidros**

An engineer and a scientist. Phaidros is very curious about Cyrus, and has a lot of respect for his mind.

**Cyrus and Paidi**

Paidi is intrigued by Cyrus’ history, and starts off with a mild fascination for him. This stagnates when she realizes that he is far more interested in machines and the mechanics of the world than with her.

**Cyrus and Lione**

Cyrus serves as a straight man to play Lione’s antics off of (similar to Serge and Kid in Chrono Cross). Lione has a lot of sympathy for the life that Cyrus has lost, and is helpful to him in interpreting his feelings about it, about which he is generally dense.

**Cyrus and Euphen**

Both of them are men out of time, and Euphen initially tries to bond with Cyrus over this. As Cyrus has repressed his loss, this does not work. Gradually, Cyrus begins to come to terms with this as it becomes clear that he cannot go home, and he and Euphen bond over this.

**Cyrus and Chiranjeevi**

Both of them have lost something, but as both are reticent, this doesn’t go much of anywhere for awhile. Chiranjeevi does harbor curiosity about his ancestors, and Cyrus has knowledge of them. Both are also near-descendants of nomadic warriors, which could be worth exploring.

**Cyrus and Sophia**

**Cyrus and Adam**

**Vaughn and Phaidros**

Phaidros was close friends with Vaughn’s parents, particularly his father. He has watched Vaughn grow up from a determined, willful child into a determined, willful adult. The pair of them share a mutual trust, and Phaidros would give anything to protect Vaughn, even if he can be gruff with him.

**Vaughn and Paidi**

**Vaughn and Lione**

As the two of them are of similar temperament, they tend to fight like siblings. Lione regards Vaughn as her obnoxious older brother, where Vaughn is initially suspicious of her status as a living weapon, but then begins to regard her as a bratty younger sister.

**Vaughn and Euphen**

Vaughn looks up to Euphen as a more worldly and experienced adventurer, although he would never openly admit it. He likes swapping stories with the older man.

**Vaughn and Chiranjeevi**

Vaughn is predisposed to distrust the Outsider, but Vaughn is not entrenched in this mindset and rapidly grows curious about what life living fully in the forest is really like.

**Vaughn and Sophia**

**Vaughn and Adam**

Only other people prevent these two from coming to blows on a regular basis.

**Phaidros and Paidi**

Paidi sees in Phaidros a strong, passionate, and wounded man. She latches onto him as a foster father. This eventually blooms into a romance, which Phaidros initially rejects but eventually warms up to. She reminds him of what it is like to be young and full of optimism for the world and for life.

**Phaidros and Lione**

Phaidros is fascinated by Lione, and initially the scientist in him takes over and he considers her as little more than a science experiment to be studied. He thinks a lot about the ramifications for their fighting force if they can reproduce her at scale. Lione, for her part, is scared and angry. She fairly associates Phaidros with the scientists that experimented on her and killed all of her friends, and this tension climaxes when she learns that his mother pioneered the initial experiments. The two come to an understanding 

**Phaidros and Euphen**

**Phaidros and Chiranjeevi**

The two begin as quite antagonistic toward each other. Both men are prideful, particularly Phaidros, and he has been exposed to a lot of anti-Outsider propaganda. Eventually, Phaidros puts Chiranjeevi to the question and the latter passes, leading to a mutual respect between the two.

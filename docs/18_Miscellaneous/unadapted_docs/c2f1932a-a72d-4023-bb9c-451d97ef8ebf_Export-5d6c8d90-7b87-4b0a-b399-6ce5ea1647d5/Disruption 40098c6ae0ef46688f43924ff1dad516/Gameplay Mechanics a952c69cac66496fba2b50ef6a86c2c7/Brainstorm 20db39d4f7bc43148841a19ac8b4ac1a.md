# Brainstorm

- **Principles**
    - Players should always consent to progressing the story–confirming that they are ready to proceed before engaging the trigger.
    - 
- **Modes**
    - Traversal
        - Mechanics
            - Sprinting
            - In-field striking: NPCs can be attacked and spontaneously engaged in combat
                - Those who advance the main quest will almost always be able to survive and kill you in response or persist until help arrives (they will spend their first turn calling for help).
                - A good way to progress would be killing off the guards one at a time, and then targeting the story NPCs.
            - Skill Checks
                - Failure does not deter advancement but alters the outcome.
        - Features
            - Guild Beast Hunts
            - Navigation: minimap
    - Battles
        - Intentions:
            - Controlling the turn order is important to winning fights
            - 
        - Design:
            - Should use a Publisher-Subscriber pattern
            - 
        - Mechanics
            - Battlefield
            - Turn Order
            - Equippable Commands (e.g. Dragoon, Magic, Thief skills, etc.)
    - Cutscenes
        - Pan the camera independently of character, display text at various parts of the screen
        - Cutscenes must run at variable speeds, which increases when the interact button is held.
        - Cutscenes should be able to happen within the battle screen
        - Cutscene controls
            - Start: Pause
                - Select: Skip
            - Select: View Script
            - RT: Fastforward
            - A: Jump to the next line of dialog
- **Implementation Details**
    - “**Display**” should have the following layers:
        - Text and Text Boxes
        - Weather: Wind, snow, sandstorm, etc.
        - Canvas
            - Ceiling
            - Fixtures: Lamps, lanterns, ceilings
            - Characters
            - Ground
    - Menus
        - Combat
            - Should have cursor memory
            - Should be touch-friendly
        - Main
            - The main pause menu should consist of the following options (ordered):
                - Equip
                - Abilities
                - Status
                    - Compare to fellow Party Members or to Bestiary
                - Items
                - Save
                - Bestiary
                - Settings
- Combat
    - Enemies
        - Enemies should be able to share a health pool
        - Enemies should be able to take up multiple spaces
        - Enemies should have parts that have both unique and shared properties
    - Skills
        - Attacking is a skill.
        - Using an item is a skill.
        - Skill effects are influenced by stats.
        - Skills can be upgraded to have multiple effects.
- Concerns
    - There is a circular dependency between Effects and Status Effects;
        - FieldEffectModifiers specify Status Effects for the sake of modifying them
        - StatusEffects have BattleEffects and FieldEffects
- Questions
    - Stats
        - Devices, Resonance, Exousia points…how should they work? Should Resonance govern something else?
        - Should physical defense be entirely governed by armor?
        - Is action point regeneration governed by stats?
    - Equipment
        - Can pieces of equipment be made into Devices via enchanting?
        - Are pieces of equipment a type of item?
    - Animations
        - Should the animations and the sounds be decoupled? Easily overridden?
    - StatusEffects
        - How do status effects differ when in the field versus when in combat?
        - Do the chances of inflicting a status effect scale with ability scores or are they linked to the skill or item?
    - Items
        - Should items be usable from anywhere?
        - Is it possible for use of an item to move you?
        - Can items target any possible position?
        - UseItem is a skill, as is attacking, dodging, etc.
        - Can the usage and effectiveness of items dependent upon ability scores?
        - Is the animation for using an item always the same?
        - Does the efficacy of an item vary?
        - Does the action cost of using an item vary? No.
    - Devices
        - Do the usages of a device vary based on field or combat use?
        - Are Devices an item?
    - Board
        - Should the board be modeled as contiguous, or two separate pieces?
            - If the latter, should units be able to occupy opposing spaces?
    - Skills
        - Is there a user-input timing element to using skills?
        - Is there a limit per battle to skill uses?

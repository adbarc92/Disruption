Game Design Document: Patternstrike
Genre: Tactical Strategy (Video Game or Tabletop RPG)Core Concept: Players defeat enemies by moving them into specific patterns or positions on a grid-based battlefield, capitalizing on spatial arrangements for maximum efficiency and damage.Target Audience: Fans of tactical RPGs (e.g., Final Fantasy Tactics, Fire Emblem) or tabletop strategy games (e.g., D&D, Gloomhaven).Date: August 02, 2025Developer: [Your Name/Team Name]  

Overview
Objective:Defeat enemies by manipulating their positions on a grid into patterns (e.g., stacking them on the same space, aligning them in rows/columns) that allow for powerful combo attacks or simultaneous damage.  
Setting:A fantasy world where warriors, mages, and rogues wield elemental powers and tactical techniques to outmaneuver monstrous foes. Players control a party of characters with unique abilities, stats, and equipment.  
Key Mechanic:  

Positioning: Move enemies, allies, or yourself to create advantageous patterns.  
Variant Goal: Stack multiple enemies on a single space to hit them all with one devastating blow.


Core Systems
1. Combat System
Battlefield

Structure: Two 9x9 grids (one for allies, one for enemies, or split as needed).  
Video Game Variant: Fully open grid with dynamic movement.  
Tabletop Variant: Predefined zones or a physical grid mat for simplicity.


Scale: Each square represents one "space" for movement and positioning.

Ability Point (AP) System

Core Resource: Players have a pool of Ability Points (AP) each turn to spend on actions.  
Starting AP per turn: 4.  
Maximum AP carryover: 6 (excess is lost).


Costs:  
Attack: 2 AP  
Defend: 1 AP  
Technique: 2 AP + 1 Resource (e.g., Source, Mana, Stamina).  
Move: 1 AP per space traveled.


Tabletop Variant: Structured Action Economy (inspired by D&D 5e):  
Each turn includes 1 Action (Attack/Technique), 1 Move, and 1 Bonus Action (Defend). AP replaced with simplified slots.



Actions

Attack:  
Description: A standard strike dealing basic damage.  
Cost: 2 AP  
Variant: Deals elemental damage (fire, ice, etc.) based on equipped weapon.


Defend:  
Description: Reduces damage taken from the next attack.  
Cost: 1 AP  
Variant: Damage reduction lasts until the start of your next turn.


Technique:  
Description: Special actions that manipulate positioning, apply status effects, or deal unique damage.  
Cost: 2 AP + 1 Resource (Source).  
Examples: Steal (take an item), Drain (siphon health), Consume (use enemy resource), Jump (leap to a space), Cast (unleash a spell).



Techniques

Cost: Requires Source (a renewable resource tied to character progression).  
Effects:  
Move yourself, enemies, or teammates.  
Inflict status effects (e.g., Stun, Burn, Slow).  
Deal elemental damage (optional).


Prototypes:  
Advancing Strike: Move self 1 space forward, push target enemy 1 space back (Cost: 2 AP + 1 Source).  
Wide Swing: Strike all enemies in a single column (Cost: 2 AP + 1 Source).




2. Character Progression
Stats

Core Stats: Simplified for tabletop, detailed for video game.  
Attack: Governs physical damage output.  
Magic: Governs technique power and elemental damage.  
Dodge: Chance to avoid attacks.  
Agility: Determines movement range and turn order.


Tabletop Variant: Stats range from 1-10, modified by equipment.  
Video Game Variant: Stats scale from 1-100 with granular progression.

Leveling

Manual Allocation: Players assign limited points to stats upon leveling (e.g., 2 points per level).  
Ability Unlocks: Specific techniques unlock at set levels (e.g., Wide Swing at Level 3).  
Flexible Assignment: Certain abilities can be equipped to any party member, but each requires its own resource (e.g., Source, Rage, Focus).

Equipment

Slots:  
Weapon (defines attack type/element).  
Head (boosts defense/Magic).  
Chest (boosts health/Dodge).  
Feet (boosts Agility/movement).  
Hands (boosts Attack/technique effects).  
Pendant (unique bonuses, e.g., extra Source).


Customization: Equipment modifies stats and enables elemental variants for Attacks/Techniques.


Gameplay Loop
Turn Structure

Player Phase:  
Spend AP on Actions (Attack, Defend, Technique, Move).  
Position enemies into patterns (e.g., stacking, rows).  
Carry over unused AP (up to 6).


Enemy Phase:  
Enemies move and attack based on AI (video game) or GM control (tabletop).


Resolution:  
Resolve damage, status effects, and positioning changes.



Winning Conditions

Primary Goal: Defeat all enemies by reducing their health to 0.  
Bonus Objective: Achieve a "Pattern Kill" (e.g., hit 3+ enemies stacked on one space).


Variants
Video Game Adaptation

Visuals: Isometric 9x9 grid with animated characters and effects (e.g., glowing patterns when enemies align).  
AI: Enemies follow scripted behaviors, reacting to player positioning.  
Progression: Detailed stat tracking and equipment crafting system.

Tabletop Adaptation

Components:  
9x9 grid mat or modular tiles.  
Character cards with stats/abilities.  
Tokens for AP, Source, and status effects.


GM Role: Controls enemies and narrates outcomes.  
Simplification: Reduce AP to a 3-action system (Move, Act, Bonus) for ease of play.


Example Scenario
Setup:  

Player controls a Warrior (Attack-focused) and a Mage (Technique-focused).  
Enemies: 3 Goblins on the enemy grid (3 HP each).

Turn 1:  

Warrior uses Advancing Strike (2 AP + 1 Source): Moves forward 1 space, pushes Goblin A into Goblin Bâ€™s space.  
Mage uses Wide Swing (2 AP + 1 Source): Hits Goblin A and B (stacked) for 2 damage each.  
Remaining AP: Warrior (2), Mage (2).

Turn 2:  

Warrior Attacks (2 AP): Deals 1 damage to stacked Goblins, killing them.  
Mage Moves (1 AP) to reposition for next encounter.

Outcome: Two Goblins defeated via pattern stacking, one remains.  

Development Notes

Balance: Ensure Techniques are rewarding but not overpowered compared to basic Attacks.  
Scalability: Add more Technique Prototypes (e.g., "Pull Vortex," "Line Burst") to expand options.  
Playtesting: Focus on grid size (9x9 vs. smaller) and AP economy (4 vs. 3 base).

Prompt for Turn-Based JRPG Worldbuilding
Create a turn-based JRPG set in a panpsychic, animist world called the Eternal Spiral, where the universe is a conscious All-Soul cycling through creation, manifestation, and transformation. A Cosmic Wound leaks unstable Exousia, a vital electric force generated by souls in sine (male, single-target) or cosine (female, AOE) waveforms, defined by amplitude (sapience, spell potency), frequency (vitality, lower spell costs), and rotation (alignment with Principalities like Wellspring or Potency). Exousia varies by race, sex, and land (e.g., forests boost Blooming spells), but toxic Exousia risks corruption.
The Synthesis Pantheon features 27 Primordial Aspects (combinations of Upper/Archetypal, Middle/Psychological, Lower/Material Realms; Force/Yang, Form/Yin, Flow/Tao Pillars; and Emergence, Manifestation, Transformation Phases). Eight Principalities (e.g., Wellspring: chaotic creation, Potency: life proliferation) shape racial and land Exousia. Players channel Aspects via Sympathetic Magic using items (e.g., Crystal Chalice) and gestures (Strike/Force, Shield/Form, Weave/Flow), casting Primal (elemental), Imbuing (constructs), Shaping (body transformation), or Blooming (life/healing) spells. Spells cost Will (20/battle, Lower: 2-4, Middle: 4-6, Upper: 6-8), modified by waveforms and terrain (+10% in aligned lands, -10% in toxic lands). Casting risks Awakening (5-15% chance of spawning Aspect spirits, +5% with toxic Exousia).
Combat occurs on a 7x7 grid, emphasizing positioning (e.g., high ground +1 Range), terrain bonuses, and AOE tactics. Ten roles (e.g., Ignivox: Primal AOE, Mendicant: Blooming healer, Bulwark: Shaping defender) feature unique Traits and Techniques with Aspect synergies. Narrative choices around Exousia use (voluntary vs. toxic) impact the Cosmic Wound, driving chaos or healing, with quests to purify lands or confront toxic extraction. Visuals include electric waveform Exousia, Blooming vines, and fractured spiral rifts; audio features waveform hums and Aspect chants; UI uses Tarot-inspired icons and spiral motifs.
The story explores moral dilemmas (e.g., toxic Exousia, Shaping immortality) and character arcs tied to Aspect shadows (e.g., Wellspringâ€™s chaos) and waveform traits (e.g., high amplitude hubris), blending tactical depth, JRPG flair, and metaphysical resonance inspired by animism, Gnosticism, and Jungian psychology.
